The thing is, I have to stay here until summer 2026 so I need to do something before I go insane, also what I study is in a creative field and I have had no inspiration whatsoever since I moved here. I barely get out because I live in a pretty far area and during the night there is no public transport, and I have no one to ask if I can sleep in their house. I don't have strong passions (I like photography but my sister at home needs the camera right now so I don't have it here), I have a bass at home but I can't find the strength to play it, I have some games on my PC but I'm not playing them. I know people who are friends of my at-home friends who I could text, and see if we get along, but I've never texted them. I know I should be contacting a therapist because I feel like I'm crawling towards depression. Also I'm struggling with university because I see I'm not prepared enough yet I don't have many ideas to pursue.

The problem is that the idea of getting a therapist here, of bringing my car here to move better at night, of making new friends here scares me to death because it means that I'm really here and I'll have to stay here until next summer, but I'd rather be in my city doing everything that I love with the people I love. I know it's stupid because the city will still be there, and friends might move but we can all see each other there during holidays. 
I feel like I've hit rock bottom several times here and I need to do something, but I also have this feeling like I've been avoiding doing all those things that could make me feel better.

I regularly consider divorce (20 years of marriage). I have a strong desire to flee my life (move and restart), but I will not do that to the kids.

I have constant inner turmoil. I like my wife and kids a lot more, but again I don't feel like I have any control.

Sometimes, I find myself absorbing all their pain and struggles, feeling weighed down by it. Yet, most of the time, I realize it's a privilege to understand them so deeply.

Both of my parents grew up facing financial hardship—a reality my mother has always been determined to spare us from. They worked so hard to protect us, over time, some of my siblings became almost too confident that our parents would always provide, whether they needed help or not. I watched this dynamic unfold, and it led me to feel responsible for our family’s well-being in ways that felt both natural and heavy.

I remember when teachers used to ask me about my dreams. I would always say, *“I want my parents to experience how life should be. I want to give them everything they’ve ever dreamed of.”* Back then, it felt so simple—like love alone could make it happen.

Now, at 25, I often feel lost. I still want that dream for them, but I don’t know how to achieve it or how to navigate my own life while trying to carry theirs, too. This, more than anything, has been the hardest part of my twenties.

Sometimes, guilt creeps in. I ask myself: *Why me? Why do I feel like I’m the only one carrying this weight? Why doesn’t it seem to affect my siblings the same way?* And then I feel selfish for even asking. I feel like I’m not allowed to complain, like doing so would betray the very struggle my mother tried so hard to shield us from.

But I’m starting to learn that I can also heal, and still feel overwhelmed. That I can love them deeply, and still need space for myself.

It is so hard to live with the shame and embarrassment of being mentally ill. Meeting people and wondering what they think about you, how they feel about you, whether they see right through you... 

Mental illness does a number on your self esteem, on your dignity, on your self confidence. You feel broken and you worry that others can see that you are not right in the head. It is heartbreaking. 

Like it or not we live in a society and humans are social beings. It matters. 

I live in a poor country with a conservative culture. Mental health education and awareness is not great here. 

I feel so lonely and isolated and trapped. We don't have support groups or anonymous help groups. People don't even understand mental illness here. 

Plus, life is really, really hard. Poverty is rampant and competition is cutthroat. You don't have the privilege of acknowledging that you are mentally ill or have intellectual or learning disabilities. 

Even my psychiatrist doesn't understand this. 

It makes me sad that I am not whole and mentally well. It breaks my heart. I wish I was. I wish I was normal. I wish I was okay. I feel so embarrassed of my broken mind and psyche. I am not okay. I want to be okay.

To give you some background, I’m in my lates 40s, not married, living alone.  I work in corporate.  Had so many family health struggles, seeing mother die (12 years ago now), so much cancer in family due to genetic mutation, had my own cancer scare a few years ago, another one these past few months (still not fully in the clear), and had a mini stroke last fall.  

For the last 25 years I have worked as much as I can to save up to move back to the mountain town where I’m from.  Was so close (like within 5%) of purchasing a little home there 5 years ago, but it got snatched up by someone else.  Then real estate prices skyrocketed here.  Rising real estate coats far outpace any salary adjustments of 3%.  I have been working 60-70 hour weeks about 80% of the time or more.  I’ve sacrificed my personal life, not seeing friends, hoping to one day still be able to catch up and get into my own place in the mountains.  I live downtown and it’s been doing me in.  I feel locked up in nothing but concrete.  The suburns aren’t any cheaper, and I have no desire to live where it’s all young families or something as I don’t need the constant reminders of that (I was unable to ever have children due to a medical condition).

Finally around end of last year investments began to regain the losses from 2022 still and I’ve been planning on moving forward to make a smaller home (1,400 sq.ft.) a reality.  Now losses of 15% just in the last week.  I’m not looking for financial advice here, but this will set me back even more years.  

I am usually very rational and understand things level out over years.  However, I am so burned out, taking care of my dad and all his needs, haven’t been able to see friends due to crazy schedules, and it’s just looking so bleak.  What is the point of life if we can never enjoy things?  I already switched employers, but it’s had to get demotions or ‘simpler’ work after you’ve been in leadership roles.  Just last month work told me they want me to take on more in a higher role.  

My health is deteriorating, my eating habits are worsening, not getting exercise, because I am completely drained after work.  I feel I have nothing more in me and I need some balance in my life so bad.

Hey everyone,

I’ve been reflecting on something that has happened to me since childhood, and I’m hoping someone here might have some insights, or might have experienced something similar. I grew up in a very fearful and depressive environment, and while I didn’t understand it at the time, I’ve noticed a recurring experience that I can’t quite explain.

Whenever I was a child (and even sometimes now at early 20s), I would experience a brief, involuntary mental ""place"" when I closed my eyes or thought about something deeply troubling. It was never something I could consciously create or control, but it would happen spontaneously—like a sudden escape or shift in my consciousness.

This place felt vast, smooth but with texture, and it had a very specific scent and sensation to it that never changed. I could never describe it fully, but it was deeply comforting for a split second. Then, in a moment, it would ""crush"" or feel like it was crumbling, it used to happend with an indivisual presence but last time it crushed on its own, which would immediately trigger a sense of fear, almost like a tightness in my chest, or a feeling of being ""tied up."" I couldn’t stay in this place for more than a second or two, and it always felt like something beyond just a regular memory or imagination. It sometimes felt like I was briefly entering another dimension or tapping into something spiritual like I was connecting to my soul, or at least a deeper part of myself.

The odd part is that it doesn’t happen every time I’m distressed, nor can I control when it happens. It’s almost like a random, involuntary experience, but I still haven’t been able to make sense of it. I’m wondering if anyone else has experienced something similar or has any idea what might be going on.

Could this be a form of dissociation or some kind of protective mental response to trauma or stress? Has anyone had a similar feeling of accessing something ""spiritual"" or ""otherworldly"" for just a brief moment? I’m really curious if therapists or anyone with a deeper understanding of the mind might have any insights into what this could be.

I’ve been focusing on my mental health, and while it’s improved slightly, my sleep still hasn’t. My schedule was bad before, but I didn’t have this issue I could sleep if I wanted to get better, but I wasn’t motivated at the time. I’ve improved my diet, started exercising, drink enough water, and cut out sugar because of this, but none of that explains why I have this fear. I’m concerned it could develop into insomnia.

Every so often I get into these weird funks, usually when I’m struggling with a depressive phase, where I start to feel strangely disconnected, stuck, and the only word I can realize use to describe it is kinda “creeped out.” Could be a symptom of acute loneliness but sometimes I feel like i’m in one of those video games where you’re surrounded by hundreds of npc’s that provide you with dialogue, interaction, instruction, etc but then you become very aware that they’re not real and there’s no soul behind them and that you’re truly totally alone in a fake world of not-real people. That’s how I feel in real life. I went on a date in another town the other night and that feeling randomly hit me. I was surrounded by people but suddenly started to feel creeped out. Like i was surrounded by people walking and talking but none of them seemed real and I seemed all alone. For no reason at all I decided I never wanted to go back to that town again even though there was nothing wrong with it. Even around my amazing sweet boyfriend i feel totally alone and disconnected. I watched Coraline a few years ago and had a panic attack because it gave me the same feeling- trapped, stuck, everything’s dark, there’s no way out, no one’s real, i’m all alone. I sound crazy but I’m seriously panicking. It feels like there’s no way out and i’m in a strange dream. 

I know- obvious answer is to get a therapist and I plan to. But it would just be helpful to put a name to these feelings so that I can start working towards a solution and articulating to a therapist or doctor how I feel. Anyone else had this?",Negative,Low Concern,,"(None, None)",,

When I am stressed out and anxious I think my brain goes into an all or nothing mode.

Like I can't find a calm middle, I either have to give in/up or do something/fightback.

Is this a actually a thing that happens to others?

Before I took medication I would get so upset about politics and social issues because they would be presented in a way that I couldn't sit well over. Mostly these were internet hot takes that affected my self worth or my anxieties about my sense of self my art and mortality. 

This would lead me to either pounding on my bed or just being depressed at giving up until I could calm myself enough to break thru.

Context: I am in a group of lovely friends where we get together at each others houses or elsewhere. Last year was a really bad year for all of us and one of my friends was eventually diagnosed with depression. 

This friend used to work on different hobbies more often and has slowed down a lot. We also had plans to create an online group to work on some things collaboratively. Our group has also had conflicting schedules due to one of them getting a new job in the past year. So therefore we haven't been getting together that often at all, months spanning between seeing each other. 

So for some stupid reason, my brain has picked up the idea that the friend who was diagnosed with depression is doing bad. Which isn't true since I've hung out with them, was told they're doing good from their partner and themselves, they're on antidepressants and is seeing a psychologist. I don't have much evidence that this friend is doing bad but my brain has exacerbated it to a bad level. 

My brain almost everyday is constantly thinking about them, how they're doing bad, how I'll get a text or phone call that they did something drastic (I don't think they're suicidal), why this, why that, blah blah blah... It's incredibly exhausting at this point. I can't just exist or go about my everyday anymore without feeling on edge or my brain racking over this friend over and over and over. I want to just have a moment of calm but it's constant anxiety at this point.

I've done almost everything I can from hanging out with them, texting them, meditation, journaling, distractions, going on walks, talking to others about it, etc. BUT. It. Still. Won't. Stop. It's affecting every part of my life at this point and it's driving me insane. I'm to a point where I don't know what to do and I'm thinking about drinking and getting weed.

I live in the US and as many of you may be aware... it's a bit of a rough place at the moment. 

I was diagnosed with depression when I was 15(currently m32) so it's been a war with reality and my brain for me for years. Current events are definitely taking their toll. A lot. I feel like I keep vacillating between anger and melancholy. Can't really remember the last time I had a really good day.

Bit more background - I'm a recovering alcoholic. I binged 6-7 bottles of liquor a week for 8 years. I started getting treatment about a year ago and have been clean for a bit. So my brain chemistry and my insides obviously weren't helped there. I see my therapist once a week and she's wonderful. Incredibly kind and pretty, has a warm aura, always gives me a big hug when the sessions are over. I'm on several medications(citalopram, lamotrigine, clonidine) and I remember to take them every day. I eat healthy generally(my idea of a treat today was to get myself a mango smoothie and a Greek salad), try to exercise regularly, have two cats, and try to make myself do things I enjoy. Therapist says I have anhedonia as well as post acute withdrawal syndrome among the rest of what's screwed up in my brain.

But honestly, it's not working. I got rid of my social media minus Reddit. Doomscrolling was making me feel worse and the nonstop bad news is like staring into a hurricane of piss. I was going back to school but dropped out two months ago because I just couldn't do it anymore. I have a decent job with good co-workers. And I don't belong to any marginalized groups in this country.

I am genuinely one of the lucky ones. And yet I feel awful every day. 

This brings me to the point of this post. I anticipate some very grim social impacts from the cuts that are happening to social services. A drastic rise in drug and alcohol abuse, more cases of mental illness, people dying out of despair or taking their own lives. I feel helpless.

And yet I am one of the lucky ones. 

What about you guys? Am I overreacting? What do you think? I just feel tremendously alone and sad right now and had to get this off my chest. ",Negative,Low Concern,US,"(39.7837304, -100.445882)",39.7837304,-100.445882

I’ve been in therapy since October 2023. I think it’s helped with some things. In early 2019 I started to get some anxiety about public speaking and it kind of altered my future plans just because of how scared and avoidant I was of it. I was scared enough to the point where I was willing to let many years waste away. I was also a little spiteful because it felt like the people I would go to to help me with it weren’t very compassionate, so it was like I was willing to fuck up my own life just to be able to say “you can’t make me face my fears”. Now I think my problems have gone far beyond just the public speaking anxiety. I was pretty isolated for like 2 and a half years, social media stresses me out, I feel overwhelmed with insecurities. I’m back at my old job and I’m trying to make my life better. I’m going out a lot more, trying to get more exposure to people. Trying to do different stuff instead of staying inside all the time. And I’ve been trying to talk to people more. I think what’s really worrying me right now is that even though I’m going back out into the world, I’m not feeling excited, happy, or inspired. And I don’t really feel connected with anyone anymore because I don’t really have friends (although I hadn’t really been trying to make any for multiple years).

I've been feeling even more depressed and anxious just because I feel like the world is filled with horrible people.

I know that internet comments are notorious for being horrible and most people tell me to disregard them... but how am I supposed to do that? Internet comments, to me, are just people expressing their inner thoughts under the guise of anonymity. But that still doesn't make those thoughts they are having any less real.

I clicked on a facebook post that was written in an uplifting way, talking about protests that were happening, and every single comment (except for a few) amongst thousands were so disgusting and hateful. I know I should avoid reading them, but I sometimes I still will. These comments were filled with hate speech, racism, massive generalizations about entire groups of people, and filled with people lacking empathy.

It's things like this that make me distrust everyone. How do I know that the person I'm talking to at the grocery checkout isn't secretly thinking these things? How can I trust them if they're acting friendly and nice and then later at home posting evil comments? I don't know why I care about these strangers... but it makes me never want to open up to anyone because they could secretly be a horrible person. And I don't want to associate with horrible people.

Even some of my my family who I've trusted, have posted horrible comments that I've found and that shocked me. And I'm honestly tired of being told, ""there are good people in the world."" I'm sure there are... but the bad ones ruin it for everyone. And the fact the I can't even look at a post of a butterfly or something without seeing comments that are hateful and politically motivated... really really upsets me.

My mother and I were constantly fighting, and not normal teenager/ mother fighting,  but not physically fighting either (99.9% of the time).

My argument was simple: she didn't listen and just wanted to use medication as a bandaid so I would stop ""acting depressed all the time"" (her words.)

Her argument was that she WAS listening but I wouldn't talk to her. Tbf, this was mostly accurate, but then again, sometimes there's no reason why you're depressed and you don't always know your panic triggers at that age. 

My therapist,  who was NOT a safe space as she basically told my mom everything I said in therapy, would of course she with my mom. At that age, I didn't understand what they meant, and no one would elaborate in a way I could understand. 

I've gotten better about it, but I had a moment today that made me FINALLY realize what they were saying. 

I missed a doctor's appointment because the schedule had been switched and I wasn't aware of it. I got a message early this morning, reminding me of my upcoming appointment with the new time, but I was asleep. When I got there (I was in a rush because I overslept), they informed me of the situation and when I left I had a panic attack. I called my friend, who is usually pretty good about bringing me back down, and they asked why. I gave him the short answer ""I missed my appointment."" He waited a second then says ""and?"" I said ""that's it. "" He tells me that he doesn't understand why that would trigger me. Then it clicked. 

I missed my appointment because I had been up for 3 days because we restarted an old medication and that's an early side effect. I've been so out of it and so overwhelmed with trying to keep up with so many different medications and feeling like a failure because the medications mess with my brain and slow me down. Almost all of them have sedative side effects, so I'm struggling with getting any type of momentum (all of this song other life difficulties I'm dealing with that he's aware of). But that's not what I told him. I only told him the tip of the iceberg because that was the final straw that triggered the attack. 

It was in that moment that I finally understood what they meant about me not communicating this entire time. From an outside perspective, the things that set me off are small. But when compounded, I'm overwhelmed. They don't see the other aspects. 

As I've said, I've gotten better at communicating, but this was just a moment of me understanding what someone else told me so long ago because it was never clarified.

Sometimes I can't control my anger at all and I'll lash out at people I love. I say things before I even have a chance to think. It feels like something is bubbling inside of me and it clouds my brain and thoughts when I'm at my limit. This happens multiple times a week (and even worse when it's that time of the month)

Even though I am always lacking motivation in general, some days I don't want to get out of bed, or talk to anyone. It becomes a chore to leave my bed and my room. I still keep up conversation with those I talk to daily when I'm in those phases, but only over text. 

I find myself wanting to make plans with people as I'm starting to feel a little better in myself. But as soon as I feel better, I'm back to either anger or depression and those plans get cancelled. 

I know I should push myself to get out of this, because the want is there sometimes. I just don't know how to actually do it ",Negative,Low Concern,,"(None, None)",,

Hello, I have to say that there will be a mild description of emotional incest. I am a 22 years old female and I have been in therapy with a male therapists for two years. In short I had childhood depression untreated along with an emotionally incestuous relationship with my mentally ill father  who I supported emotionally.  Also when I was teen my father would stare at me in a sexual way. To conclude my history females in my family would sometimes become physically aggressive and abandon me and as a hypersensitive person it affected me. I started therapy because in my first relationship my symptoms got worse and I could not get intimate without having self destructing thoughts.  
My clinical psychologist works psychodynamically and has helped me a lot to the point that I have almost 2 years that I am physically intimate. From a transference point I have got overly dependent on him and because i feel he does not understand me I feel I am relapsing. 
He says I that when I was a child I was not platonically partly in love with my dad but I wanted him to penetrate me as a child. I feel he does not get how although nothing physical happened I felt violated by my father and I felt he was victim blaming me (the therapists).
He says that I also wanted a male organ that is why I feel inferior . and the inconsistent feelings of love and hate I have towards my mother are because I was jealous. 
The point is this is the first person I talk like this and I have become overly dependent I see him as a father figure and I am afraid to leave , I don't know , I feel he does not get the subtle deep wounds of my childhood. Last session I was verbally hostile and then cried. I am at the same time terrified to leave but I have extreme distrust. 
I feel it us a therapists issue. Today after work I just sat and cried for hours I feel empty. I dont want to be traumatized again. Thanks so much for reading and for any comment",Negative,Low Concern,therapy with,"(33.5510967, -111.893243)",33.5510967,-111.893243

My school is quite stressful, but my crying hasn't stopped over the summer and winter breaks so I don't think it's from that. 
I mainly start crying when I feel like a disappointment for my boyfriend and parents or when I think that I can't get anything right. I feel as if I have lost all my hobbies and interests and my grades went downhill since all of this started. I was tested for depression but I wasn't diagnosed and the same is for anxiety. I notice that people get uncomfortable when this happens and I get avoided at school because of it. 
I went to therapy for six months but nothing improved and everything is getting blamed on the stress. I feel even worse on weekends and I actually quite like going to school even though I am failing. 
I was on antidepressants before I was tested for depression, due to having chronic headaches and insomnia before, because nothing seemed to help. The insomnia is gone now, but I still get headaches every single day.
I cry four to nine times a day and I feel like this is really affecting my life at this point, because I can't do anything or even have a normal conversation without being on the verge of tears. 
Before this happened I hardly ever cried and the crying didn't gradually get worse or anything. It just randomly started one day and doesn't seem to stop. 
I would love to hear your opinion on this, because I genuinely don't know what I should do.

Hey! I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this, but here we go. For the past 3 years, so much has happened in my life. 

In the past, I  never had many friends. The friendships I struggled to create didn't last long either. My school life was far from great. One could say I did awesome, but that would be only if you cared about the results. I didn't have any trouble with studying, but rather the time spent there. In the beggining, other kids kind of hated me for being sort of a nerdy introvert, often making fun of me for being quiet. Later, I managed to isolate myself, and the ""bullying"" stopped, but at the cost of being isolated. 

Then, 2 years ago, my parents started having problems. There is a lot that happened, and it is hard for me to talk about it too much, but it ruined me. My already bad mental health fell down to hell. I became depressed, and cut ties with everybody I knew. I just wanted to be alone. At this part in my life, I became the definition of isolation. I had noone. No friends, no parents, not evem my dog who died year prior. I was completely alone. 

But life moved on. I never forgave them (and won't), but I at least moved on. My life got better for the first time. Then I got accepted to  one of the best highschools in my country. And I finally made friends! 

But those long years of suffering have left an mark on me. Everyone I talk to, I just feel like they hate me. Even my friends, they don't, obviously, by my mind keeps telling me they do. I'm just so used to people hating me that I don't know how to move on. I feel like everyone would be happier without me. That they don't want me to bother them, but just are polite enough to let me stay. That I make their blood boil, and they can't wait till I leave. I just feel like everybody hates me. Even myself. That's not just a feeling, and I do hate myself, but it's not important to this post. 

What am I supposed to do? How do I stop feeling that way? I'm really lost. ",Negative,Low Concern,,"(None, None)",,

I'm 20(f) and i can't stop this cycle. 

Every couple of years, everything and everyone starts to aggravate me and results in me isolating myself. I isolate myself because being on my own feels better than constantly being aggravated and triggered by everyone around me and making a fool of myself. 

I tend to over explain so I'll try to keep it short — I've done this 2 other times. Life starts to feel overwhelming? I start finding absolutely little to no joy being around people and so I stop responding, stop trying in school (graduated now), and have even quit jobs because of this. The thought of doing anything just irritates me and i start crying / almost having anxiety attacks over the smallest things like not having ice to put in my cup. The only time I can feel calm and like I'm not going to cry / explode is when I'm alone in my room. Even my pets, my soul reason for getting out of bed in the morning, start to irritate me by doing the littlest things. 

My body starts to feel physically fatigued, when I get irritated my throat gets tight and I feel like I can't breathe and I have to find a place by myself before I can't take it anymore. And then after a few months or even 1-2 years, I feel better again and don't even really know what changes. 

I'm sure there's more I'm just not realizing but this is all I can think of right now. It's exhausting and I get so lonely but it feels better than being irritable by everything. 

Some things that might play a part in it : 

This first happened when I was first diagnosed with an autoimmune disease called ankylosing spondylitis, a form of rheumatoid arthritis, I got diagnosed at 16 so it was considered juvenile. I was also diagnosed with adhd the same year (late diagnosis) and was on the depo shot for hormones, I've been diagnosed with generalized anxiety since I was 12 and have struggled with depression since the same age but they didn't diagnose me because they assumed my hormones had something to do with it. 

I stopped depo almost 2 years ago due to insurance but have started it again about a month ago, and I was on adderall fro adhd until about december of 2024, now i take 40 mg of vyvanse. I also take methotrexate for my condition, and 90 mg of duloxetine for my anxiety / depression symptoms and my irritability from the first time i felt like this in like, 2021-2022. 

I know my medications probably have a lot to do with this — especially with depo but i didn't feel like this until this week and i'm worried about it so soon because i know once this feeling starts, i just spiral and I have 2 really good friends that I don't want to lose but i can feel myself getting more and more aggravated with them and it's exhausting. 

I'm more just venting but I thought maybe posting could help me feel normal. 

is this normal? what do i tell my psychiatrist if i'm wanting help? do i have to see a therapist?

i have this problem, its one of my biggest issues asides from my anxiety and depression, but i don't know how to explain it. it's something i've been suffering with for awhile, some sort of obsession with tv shows / anime / movies / books / games. etc.

i get this pit feeling in my chest whenever i see media of something i'm interested in, a sensation that kind of hurts, makes me feel miserable. i don't know if part of it is a sense of envy or longing, i've never been able to decipher what is it. no matter what i search or how long i look online, i can never seem to find anyone with the same issue. by a previous counsellor, i've been told that i had the possibility of autism, which is where some of the 'obsession' things can shine through, but it still doesn't align properly. i can't even watch the shows i like anymore, it gives me a feeling of emptiness and makes me feel like more of an outsider than i already am.

of course i'm not saying i am autistic, especially when i dont have a proper diagnosis. i only brought it up because i'm trying to put all the information together, if that makes sense.

i even had to delete instagram because i kept getting content of an anime i used to watch before i got 'ill,' and it would put that pressuring feeling on my chest. i would feel bad for some unknown reason, and i just don't understand why i can't interact with stuff like a normal person. i can't even listen to anime intro's and such because it results into a similar feeling. it doesn't even have to be something i've watched either or know about, just seeing a screencap of an anime with draw out that feeling.

it's a frustrating feeling not knowing whats wrong with me, and i came here in hopes somebody had answers, or share a similar feeling.

Idk if this is something anyone can relate to or give advice on.. so here I am. 

I (F28) have been with my bf for 10+yrs. Had the inevitable honeymoon period, dead bedroom due to cheating (not me) and depression (me), kids and in the last few years we’ve really focused on our sex lives and figuring out our kinks so our sex is really good and we have it regularly with me mostly initiating as I’ve got a higher sex drive. 
Our relationship is not perfect though and has ups and downs. 

In the last few years I’ve also got into reading again and ended up on the more dark side of booktok… don’t judge me. 

My problem that has seemed to develop recently is that I’m obsessed with sex or masturbating and get really low if I’m rejected by my bf. I also seek out validation from him/ others (girl friends) constantly and feel like I want to look hot/ sexy all the time to feel good about myself and both this + the tiny euphoria feeling you get from sex/ masturbating are like an obsession. 

I am good looking, have no reason to be trying this hard as I don’t have confidence issues. Cheating happened like 5+yrs ago and was all resolved so it’s not that as well. 

I work out a lot, into podcasts, reading, tv, travelling etc to keep myself busy and still I get distracted and want sex etc. 

I’ve visited doctors who want to put my on birth control to sort out my sex drive which doesn’t agree with me, in active therapy with no real help here. 

I feel slightly like a sex maniac/ slut? Anyone got any similar feelings or have any advice on how to deal with this?

i struggle with body dysmorphic disorder and so i have an extremely difficult time seeing my physical appearance accurately. it’s like i’m essentially dissociated from what i look like. 

however, i am also an extremely perceptive individual. scarily perceptive. reading people is my superpower. and i’ve come to understand that people treat me a certain way because of the way i look. 

i am a pretty girl. maybe even very beautiful. 

i think maybe over the past year and a half i started to grow into my features more (i’m still a teenager). people started treating me and looking at me differently. 

for example: 

-girls at school and in public will be envious of me. they’ll constantly stare at me every single time i’m around with no fail. their demeanor will change and they’ll become insecure. they will persistently copy my mannerisms. …it is extremely aggravating to deal with. especially since i don’t view myself that way, i’ve lived a generally traumatic and depressing life, and i think anyone who’s jealous of me probably has more advantages in the world than i do. 

-even grown female teachers i have will copy my mannerisms. or stare 

-grown men in public will stare at me without fail. anytime i go anywhere they will stare. i just expect it at this point because it is every time. even if i’m not wearing makeup. 

-sometimes people get nervous around me 

-there’s this constant fear or anxiety i live with of showing vulnerability or letting my insecurities become visible in public. i feel like i can’t have a bad day. i can’t show emotions like a regular person. i’m scared people will use it against me and treat me like shit. i fully believe that if a genuinely pretty girl seems insecure or sad people will take all their chances to put her down, because they can and because they’re insecure. i provoke reactions in people. it’s like throwing tomatoes at the girl who makes you insecure because you are delusional enough think she “has it all going for her” 

-my aunt’s boyfriend asked me very randomly “do people stare at you?” …i responded “yes, all the time” ….he says “like do boys come to your school?” …since i go to an all girl school. then i ask why he would ask that and he says “oh i don’t know. just random. people stare at me ….” and then he goes on changing the subject. like i’m stupid 

-if i walk with confidence people will assume i’m stuck up. i know this because sometimes when i’m getting somewhere and i accidentally GENTLY push against someone’s arm in a CROWDED hallway they will say things like “what an asshole” “she literally just bumped into me” “bitch”. even though people bump into me all the time and i read it as an accident without thinking about it twice. 

i don’t know if anyone can help me with this but i feel very uncomfortable about it. and i think as i grow even more into my features it will get worse for me. 

also i’m a lesbian so i don’t want any advice on men please 😭 maybe warding them off because i doubt i’ll ever be able to be friends with a guy unless they’re gay or asexual.",Negative,Low Concern,what,"(51.591817649999996, -3.2165513050710213)",51.591817649999996,-3.2165513050710213

The turning point happened when I realized: this isn't laziness, it's not weakness - it's a condition you can work with. I started:

Watching my sleep. Even if I didn't feel like sleeping - I went to bed at the same time.

Add minimal activity: at least 10 minutes of walking, even just getting up and warming up.

Look for real examples of people who have done this.

I’ve been in therapy for 3 years, on SSRIs for anxiety, and I thought I had made real progress. I finished therapy a year ago. I thought I was getting better at recognizing and managing my patterns. 

In January, I met a 40M on Tinder. Things moved quickly. He introduced me to his family, took me on trips, planned weekends, gave me gifts. There was chemistry and affection. But he was dominant, made hurtful “jokes” (blaming me for my parents’ divorce, saying no one was desperate enough to propose to me), subtly criticized my lifestyle, mocked people with mental health struggles. 

Over time, the warmth faded. He stopped being affectionate — just sex, no cuddling, no softness. He forgot basic things like when I was traveling. I started feeling intense anxiety around him — physical panic, nausea, emotional numbness. I didn’t feel safe to open up. I was scared and frozen.

Then, out of nowhere, I sent him a single message: **“I don’t see the point of continuing this. I’ll send your things.”**

No fight. No conversation. No warning. Just emotional shutdown.

He was shocked, devastated. Said I stabbed him in the back, that I was disloyal and he’d never trust me again. And honestly, I can’t blame him.

The thing is — I’ve *never* ended a relationship before. Even bad ones. I’d always stay until the other person left. I’ve never had a long-term partner either, despite my age. I know what I did. Detached. Abrupt. Unfair.

I feel like this at work but also in therapy. How can I change this?

My therapist keeps telling me that I am being defensive. But it's hard changing that. Many times, I feel like a child among adults because of the way I talk or act (high pitch voice or I gesticulate a lot).

My job is affecting my mental health, I am severely burntout and I'm pretty sure I'm depressed even though I thought it was just an episode.

But it feels so invalidating that even my therapist minimizes my feelings and I think it might be also because of my way of being (talking, making myself small so that others feel better, lack of confidence, people pleasing in general, not being able to set boundaries or express myself concisely and in a firm way, I am affected easily by how others treat me). I think all of these things make people not take me seriously. But I feel like this is my essence and I can't change my personality just like that. I've been sure that I might have ADHD but my therapist and other people around me brushed it off. I still feel like something is wrong but I don't know what. They say it's just anxiety but at this point I don't know anymore.

There are so many issues with how I feel but can't find the reason. And it doesn't feel like therapy is helping either. I want to do some assessments separate from my therapy, I just need to find the courage.

My psych has recently shifted my diagnosis towards bipolarity, and finally accepted that the SSRIs they've cycled me through over the last four years haven't been helping. They've actually made things significantly worse. 

I'm not able to have follow ups with my psych, but have them with my gp who sometimes leaves notes for my psych. This system is what led to nobody noticing that me ""feeling better"" half a week after starting Zoloft was actually a big hypomanic warning sign to not keep taking SSRIs. 

Six months ago I was put on lamotrigine. I stabilized ish, but it made my hormones go crazy and the breast pain wasn't letting me sleep. I've now come down to 100 mg of lamotrigine and 20 mg of latuda, and I seem to be kind of stable here so far. I wouldn't necessarily say I'm doing well, but my world isn't on the verge of crashing down. Also adding that I'm mostly depressive, and I also have mixed episodes. 

However, I've noticed over the last few months I've been having some cognitive issues. Word recall issues sometimes (I enjoy language and know I have a decent vocabulary so this bothers me), and memory issues. Some things I still remember just fine, it's not stopping me from doing my job or anything. But more and more when I try to remember a certain time, I can remember the setting and the people and have a general idea of what was going on, but when I try to reach for anything specific, there's nothing there. Or yesterday I noticed a hair elastic on my wrist, but I know I haven't had on in over a year since I cut my hair short, so I have no idea where I got it or how long it had been there. This stuff really scares me, a lot. I feel like my life is being taken away.

I'd like to switch to lithium and keep the latuda, it appears to be labelled as a safe and effective combination, but there are still so many studies on cognitive decline with lithium as well. I'm just terrified that even if I find something that works, I'm going to start losing my mind in a different way before I'm even fifty. I'm so scared of my long term prognosis with this thing. 

Is there anyone here who's on the other side of it? I don't know if there's anyone in their 70s or 80s, but even anyone in their 50s or 60s who could tell me what their experience is like, what I can be doing to mitigate certain side effects, anything that might be helpful. Huge bonus points if you have a story about how you've been on lithium for twenty years or something and it's wonderful and you have no issues with memory and your life is amazing.

Had depreessive episodes since I was 14 years old and no medication ever really helped. When I was 20 I turned my life around lost a lot of weight (50kg) and exercised and ate healthy. I felt pretty good and thought I overcame my depression etc.

However I'm 22 now and the last 2 years have been hell. I dont know why but out of nowhere I start feeling extremely depressed, insane brain fog and head aches/tension, binge eating a lot, can't think straight and irritable, feel like I dont have control over myself and I get this feeling of continiously losing myself more and more. Some days I get a glimpse of feeling ""normal"" again. Have a little bit clearer head, more leveled out, more present etc. Far from perfect but ALOT better than these negative phases, which unfortunately take up about 90% of my life the past 2 years.

Tried several antidepressants, antipsychotics, stimulants, mood stabilizers, Vit D, Omega 3, etc. got my hormones checked, sleep kinda checked (I got this EKG for 1 night but I would like a complete sleep study). I tried all these things but I still get these phases where I feel like I'm going insane.

Please I don't want these life impairing symptoms anymore. I can't study properly anymore, I eat way too much and am scared of gaining back all the weight, I want to have fun again doing things like sports etc. I literally don't know what going on with me, I feel like I have some kind of sickness or something idk. Waking up exhausted everyday and feeling the same is destroying my mental health and I'm scared of losing myself completely if this keeps going on.

Nothing yet has really improved my symptoms/mood so I'm asking you guys for advice. What could I try out or what should I get checked out because my situation is far from normal and it's taking my life away.

I failed the internship that could have given me a job. I'm not sure what happened and I feel like a failure. I never really had any self-confidence, my I knew I had found the job for me.

 I went back to school as a young mother approaching 30 and studied with passion in the field. I got excellent grades. But I didn't get THE internship. I gave it my all. This was the first time my supervisor had taken on an intern. Right from the start, I sensed that my internship supervisor didn't seem interested in training anyone. He often sent me off with others or neglected me and went off to do his own thing. But I tried. I asked for his feedback, but he wasn't someone who communicated with me, so I never knew if what I was doing was right or wrong. During the internship evaluation, he brought up several situations that would have happened that I have no recollection of. Yet these were events that would have had an impact on me. I recognize some of the mistakes I've made, but I can't remember some of the things I've been accused of. He even said I needed to hise my tattoos event tho they never said that to me and there was a lot of other peoples with tattoos !

What's more, many of my shortcomings could have been eliminated if my supervisor had given me feedback on my work. He even told me after I'd failed that he wouldn't be taking any more intern because it wasn't what he thought it was and he didn't believe it was right for him

So I was his test. My future was a test for this person. I could apply again for the job in one year but I just cant help but wondering if I was this bad.

It's about my mental health and how it doesn't seem to improve, even though I'm ""pushing trough"". 

I would summerize my problems as not enjoying life enough. I am functional in life, but I don't hold strong passions. Even as a child I realized that I don't want to do much. But following this thought came the realization that ""doing is good"" in a way, so I pushed myself to do sports, sociolize and put effort into school. Not amazingly much, but enough to stay active, stay moving. All these things I did and do intentionally. And it never seems to become a habit or an impulse I don't have to actively control.

For example I like the idea of spending time alone and doing stuff like drawing or any other kind of artistic expression. (But doing that stuff makes me anxious, which is why I don't draw anymore) Now, if I spend too much time which might be a few hours to a day, I get anxious and my mood worsens. I might not actively enjoy my time with friends, but not spending time with them is the worse outcome. I get anxious if I can't arrange for social activity bc deep down I know this will worsen my condition. 

I have tried to do more introspection and work on my mental health, but I just don't know where to start. I know my self esteem is low and just the everpresent vibe/feeling of myself and the world seen through my eyes is unpleasant. It's somewhere between anxious, ugly and meaningless. I tried to get used to it more, but that doesnt necessarily help. Actually, getting away from myself is more useful. 

I don't think I was traumatized, more like my genes carry an affinity for depression and my parents neglected me emotionally. 

I am really at the end of my robe there. Right now I am traveling Japan as a last ditch effort bc the idea of it was really existing before my travel. Now that I'm here, I'm in the same mental state of functioning and coping, but really just waiting for it all to be over.

Recently, I’ve been in a mental health block. I’m currently medicated for major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety, and ADHD. I’ve been through this loop before and somehow made it through it, but how do I prevent this from happening?

I lost a family member a few months ago, and I just lost my grandma a few weeks ago. I’m watching family members around me grieve, or at least trying to. My father doesn’t know how to grieve since this was his first death that hit home the most. He isn’t taking care of himself and is refusing any help. Granted, it’s only been a few weeks, but seeing him like this is hard. He’s a middle-aged man who was told he isn’t allowed to feel emotions because that’s “not what men do.” My family and I are trying to convince him otherwise, but that’s generational trauma for you. Heck, I don’t grieve people’s deaths, either. I don’t know how. I held her hand and sobbed as I looked at her. I was in my grandma's house a few hours after she passed in the hospital, looking through her things, looking for papers needed for the death certificate. 

Before anyone says anything, I know how I handle my emotions isn’t correct. I often push most of my feelings to the back of my mind and wait for one final thing to take me over the edge, where I have a full meltdown over the multitude of issues I’ve been bottling up. Until that moment hits, I become numb. I sit there emotionless as I watch life go by. Others see it as I self isolate and no one knows what to do. They’ll ask me how I’m doing and if everything is okay, but I don’t have an answer because I genuinely don’t know how I feel. No one can help because I don’t know what’s wrong with me either. This is a repetitive cycle that continues on and on. I don’t even know what to do. I just want to sob so hard that I can’t breathe, my head pounds, where I shake, my nose is a faucet, and I have to gasp for air over and over again. Sadly, when I go through that, it makes me feel alive, that I’m still here, that I’m not in a constant loop of life, and that I can feel emotions other than numbness. 

I don’t want to watch a TV show or read a book that makes me sad because, sure, that can work, but then I’ll overthink that book or movie, and that would be a constant loop in my head. I've been there, done that. I’m trying therapy again, but it’s been a while since the last time due to financials. 

I’m unsure why I’m writing this, other than asking how I do not feel like this? How do I get rid of the numbness? No cliche answers of “go outside,” “exercise,” or “spend time with loved ones.” My loved ones are also depressed, and I can’t help them if I’m like this. I’m the one who helps others when they’re down, but I can’t do that because I’m giving up paddling the water below me. I’m drowning.  I’m tired of feeling like this or having this be so reoccurring. I’m tired; I’m exhausted. I’m tired of paddling.

I apologize for my long-winded rant; I just needed to put something out there that wasn’t in my journal or notes app. ",Negative,Low Concern,happening,"(32.1136798, 34.803471351671874)",32.1136798,34.803471351671874

To anything. 

I'm depressed and in therapy. (I just started - I'll ask my therapist about this, but I'm going everywhere for pointers. I thought I should say upfront that I am in therapy.)

I have a habit of taking a nap at about 4-5 PM and sleeping until anywhere from 6 to 9 PM. It's almost like nodding off from heroin. (which I've never taken, that is strictly imagination.) It's not like being good tired and sleeping. It's bone-deep weariness from life - from not wanting to be here. I just give up and go to bed. I pull the covers over my body and I escape from reality...

When I wake up I'm disgusted and in a semi-stupor. 

I can't keep this up. It's interfering with my functioning. I work from home so I can make my own schedule but this cuts down on my productivity big time.

Any suggestion is welcome.

she says that the root of the argument is always my phone, but i sort of have this internal rage that she’s betrayed me or something by starting to drink again because she knows very much how it affects me. when she’s drunk she’ll also just say really horrible things to me. i’ve told my sister who is 8 years older than me and my sister has spoken to her about it before but my mum pretends to my sister that she’s stopped and whenever i want to call my sister to tell her it’s happening again my mum takes away my phone. i don’t know what to do and i feel like im trapped in a loop of her relapsing.

also we live in a small town so i don’t think there is any alcoholic support things i can refer her to. now that im thinking it if i showed her one she’d probably be very angry. she knows it’s happening but she doesn’t want to confront the problem. i have a lot of sympathy for my mum as during the divorce with my father she was diagnosed with PTSD and is currently attending therapy so please don’t shame her for it.

I’ve been to so many places for help: psychiatrists, therapists, my family doctor, the ER, crisis centers, psych wards, group therapy. Every time I spoke up, I was dismissed. Sometimes even laughed at. I’ve been told I’m “too complex” or I don’t have ptsd or to “just stay positive,” and sent away, only to get worse each time. I stood up for myself and I asked for care and I didn’t hold back on any of my thoughts. I was straight up ignored/dismissed.

I have severe CPTSD, OCD, and chronic suicidal thoughts that are getting more intense. It’s all I can think about. I haven’t left the house (except for medical appointments) since July. I haven’t seen or spoken to anyone besides my toxic family in over 5 months. I’m on disability due to my mental health and can’t afford to move or access proper care and its deeply affected my social life. I lost my relationship and all my friendships. I now live with severe chronic pain that makes it feel nearly impossible to go outside without having a panic attack so intense it feels like I’m dying.

I’ve tried meds, but they all caused serious side effects because of my worsening physical health. I tried paying out of pocket for a private therapist, but a 50 min once-a-month session doesnt do much when you’re in survival mode 24/7.

So while it did feel like I was in her shadow at times (she was a senior while I was a freshman) it also came with an almost built-in social life. I knew a lot of people from my school because of my sister and had the entire football team so I never really felt alone. I also had my group of friends there that I would consider ride or dies. At the time it felt like I could not do anything without the judgement of someone I knew looking over me.

But ever since spring break ended I have just had this overabundance of loneliness.

Sorry in advance but I’m all over the place so my story might be a bit fragmented and English is not my native language!

Shit parents, sister that I’m not close with at all, still live with my mother, ugly as mf, have no friends and i started to hate my job for a long time. Haven’t really done anything in my life due to stupid financial decisions of my parents and i had to help pay a lot of debt. All of my money were going for it for the last 15-16 years. All of my friends back then started to live their adult lives, getting out of their parents houses or buying cars, getting girlfriends, going out, traveling, meeting people and making connections while i was having pocket money just for the evening and going back home to my parents. So in time i started to feel ashamed and stopped going out. For years i have social anxiety so i don’t go out unless it’s something for work (i work from home) so quite a lonely life. I think the lack of money and not being independent all these years made my way of thinking stay childish, i had no way to mature and become a man, and saying that at my age is just sad.

Being bald, wearing glasses, being a bit overweight and living with my mother doesn't really make me a catch as well. I’m pretty much a caricature. For a very long time I’ve been telling myself that i don’t want a girlfriend or a family but truth is that’s a defensive mechanism. I still think I’m a good person who deserves love and i have a lot of love to give but unfortunately i don’t think that’ll ever happen. I try to be as realistic as possible me not going out, having social anxiety, being ashamed to talk to women and being awkward in general pretty much leads me to my way of thinking. Women my age are looking for mature and experienced man who doesn't look like a meme. I don’t have a lot of sexual experience so I’m bad at that too. I don’t even have a car although i got my driving license 2011 but back then i still had hopes for the future.  

With no hopes for a better future and with the years passing by i almost ended myself 3 years ago. I was very very close to doing it but at the end i didn’t.

Nothing changed that much for these 3 years other than i got lonelier, as depressed as before and bored of life. Since almost half of my life i spent home that’s pretty much my world. My way of thinking is not to go out and enjoy life my way of thinking is “Let me find some Youtube video to watch or a TikTok video where people enjoy life.” Sad i know but that’s my reality.

I have no idea what happened to me a few weeks ago but i watched a Youtube video about weight lifting at home and i got interested. I bought some weights and I’ve been training for 3 weeks and using a stationary bike that we had for ages. If you ask me why i do something that will prolong my lonely, pointless and sad life i can’t answer you. I guess it’s all of boredom and it’s something that will pass in a few more weeks.

Well that’s my sad story! I don’t really have any questions and i don’t really ask for any tips i just wanted to vent a bit.

I wish everyone good luck and a better life!

I feel uncomfortable playing games with them. I feel uncomfortable watching a movie with them. I don't want to spend time with them. I especially don't want to be around my sister. She used to hit, bite, scream at and chase me when we were kids (She has a mental disability) She is 21 now and our relationship greatly improved, but that trauma is still there and being around her makes me extremely uncomfortable, her horrible social skills due to living in the attic for years doesn't make it any better. I try to avoid her the best I can. I have a bad relationship with my father. He has the emotional intelligence of a 4 year old and talking with him is impossible. After an argument he stopped talking to me altogether, just saying hi when we pass by each other and that's it. My Mom is a lot better, but still not someone I like spending time with. The only intelligent one is my oldest sister and I have a great relationship with her, but she doesn't live with us. I'm angry because my Psychiatrist acted like if we would all just spend time together, everything will be fixed, even though he barely knew anything about our family, except that we are all on our own. He suggested family therapy but I doubt it would do anything. My family was never meant to be together and it's too late already. This whole situation is just pissing me off and I wish things were different. I wish they were people I would love spending time with but they're the exact opposite and it's probably the biggest cause for my depression. I have no privacy and I hate it here.

I had childhood friends but i lost them all overtime.. not really able to actually ever reach out for them or maintain those relationships and mostly we also just grew apart.

Being a loner for quite a while I was lonely but also gained some content with my life(or may have just given up on trying to change this).

Now roughly a year ago things changed.. I actually made friends at work… got invited into a social circle and got the feeling of being part of a community. Life is now better.. Yet everything feels much more complicated.

I’m still not satisfied, it's more like a flood of new feelings and heightened emotions got introduced into my mind. Hope for life to be better and disappointment that things do not progress as much as i would like to.

Just being around and getting acknowledged feels actually so great.. even though i know that the relationships are still quite shallow. I’m just the weird guy with his special interests and particular knowledge about certain things. Still people seemingly like me for that, invite me to events and just hang out with me.

Yet the more I hang out with them the more I feel myself becoming dependent on them. Being alone now feels so much worse.. to a point where i avoid getting home and instead spend more time at work for the opportunity to see them. Everytime i leave some kind of social event I start feeling like shit because it's over. I’ve come to realize how bad my life was before and I'm afraid of ever going back to that. 

Still I'm also disappointed that I haven't developed deep friendships and emotional intimacy already, because I also have no idea how to actually be close to others.

Skewed by movies, anime and tv shows my expectations of friendships/best friends may be unrealistic but I could still cry about all those moments when people are just there for each other and get to have those exciting adventures…

Even in reality.. now i’m bombarded with all those great stories people have to tell… which just makes me feel “being new at life” So many things i never did or learned or became really good at. Life skills I don't have… like a child among adults.

So while I actually do feel that things are now better… and on the way of going even further… I'm also becoming aware of a whole bunch of issues starting to grow and fester in my mind.

Inferiority complexes, loneliness, fear of rejection and being abandoned…. The relationships felt unbalanced from the start. I have no one, but they… they still have each other.. their own friend circles… even partners. It makes me envious and afraid of possibly not being good enough.

On bad days my mind would try to tell me that I'm just a curiosity.. the pet of the group… people may like to see me and my antics but that's it.. soon they will be bored of this and turn away.

I know that this is very much not true and it's probably more my lack of visible investment that it currently does not progress much further.. because i’m generally more passive and don’t really initiate events or meetups on my own. The fact that I also often kind of appear to be helpless/confused and to follow others around like a lost puppy probably doesn’t help. It's just what I like to do once I can recognize someone as being “safe” to be around.

Also sorry for that wall of text.. there is just so much i would like to get out at once and it feels hard to actually formulate my own thoughts.

Like a muscle that needs to be stretched, but the muscle literally just doesn't exist. I get all restless until it's over, unable to sit still and requiring basically constant stimulation.
I talk fast, it feels really uncomfortable to sit still, I get easily distracted and I am unable to fully focus. 
I often end up scouring steam for games in hopes that the games I buy will fix that need for stimulation, but it often ends up being a waste of money as it just sits there in my library. That and overwhelming myself with loud music or watching some yt vid is what works best to distract myself, even if it doesn't help at all.
These episodes often last for like a couple hours, but now I've got this really intense one that's been going on for like half a day and is only now beginning to wear off.
I've never really thought about them too much since they've been happening for as long as I remember, but my mother came in when I was in the middle of this intense one and said I sounded manic when speaking.

I've also got these really bad depressive episodes and just emotional numbness in general, and google says that having both depression and manic episodes is a sign of bipolar disorder, but the description doesn't feel like it fits, and I've taken like three random tests online that all say I don't have it either (i know online tests are like a sin in mental health but still) so I'm wondering what this could be?

Answering texts seem so natural to others, but it straight up gives me anxiety attacks most of the time, especially if I don't know the person well. It's not like not answering solves the problem either. I just keep thinking I am an awful person for not being able to do something this easy. 

I feel like this is more common than people will recognize and I can see why nobody dares talking about it. I've been bullied for that before. ""Excuse me mrs. president"" ""it's only a text"" ""i dont see the point of having a phone then"" ""what if i got kidnapped"" and so on with even more ridiculous scenarios to make me feel bad. 

To me it used to be more of a principle then. People aren't made to be in communication 24/7. Conversations are MEANT to end at some point, which they were before because of physical limitations. Now you have to dedicate a whole part of your life to staying in touch with everyone, everyday, because everyone just expects you to do so. 

But now it's more about anxiety managment. It's been two months since I've ghosted my bestest of friends with whom I have always been able to keep up with without so much trouble. Since the day my family dog passed away. I don't know, I think I just snapped. I can't even see a notification from them without panicking. It's so bad. Even when trying to force myself it just sends me into a never ending spiral of extreme stress and even chest or lower back pain at times. 

Since high school ended (was quite bad), a few of my best friends have moved away in another country to study. It's quite common where I'm from, I thought I would go too but in the end I chose to stay, since a really good school opened near home and I didn't want to leave my elders and my family dog behind. But now doggy's left us, and everything's sort of been a blur ever since. I feel so diconnected from them now. 

Their lives are cool, they go out, hang out while I just come home to sleep and feel miserable after school. Their problems and concerns feel so far away from mine. So grown up even though we're the same age. I still adore them but I can't support some of the things they now do which has traditionnaly always been against my values : drinking a lot, partying, bad frequentations, etc. I remained the ""no trouble kid"".

Edit: correction to the Title. 
""I'm sinking and feel like I can't do anything about it.""

TL;DR: I'm a mental wreck with many problems and am scared to do anything about it because of religious social pressure from friends and certain family members. 

I'm a full time LDS proselytizing Missionary. I have a strict schedule from 6:30 am to 9:30 pm of studying scriptures, out and proselytizing, be frugal in time set apart for meals and exercise, a half day off once a week to do chores/errands and talk to family 1800 miles away, among many other things. This is a high demand 2 year commitment that emphasizes forgetting yourself and serving others, no matter what. And if you struggle, then shut up and keep serving. Feeling depressed, down, burnout, or something of the like? Too bad keep it to yourself and have faith and trust in God and that he'll make it work out for you. 

I've had a porn habit that has been a hinderance and coping mechanism for 10 years. Those familiar with LDS faith and culture know it's severely frowned upon, especially as a missionary. 

I've been experiencing 2-3 day relapses every 1-2 weeks, sometimes 3. I go without it for a little while, but then stress and unprocessed emotions/issues build up and I relapse. I'm expected to be on this pillar, and then turn around and sin, and it's because ""I have no desire to change. I'm not trying hard enough. I'm doing it wrong"" among other things I'm told. I'm taught by LDS doctrine that God's loving me is conditional upon my exact obedience to his commandments. Fail to do so and I no longer abide in his love. My relapses are my fault because I choose to relapse. And not trust in the grace and help of my Savior. 

I should mention I'm also in the process of questioning my previously held beliefs about the LDS church after finding out the truth of its true history, and the errors in its doctrines, not the white washed version they teach in Sunday school. The deeper I go the more difficult it becomes to uphold something that's evidently not what it claims. I mention this as it's the framework for my worldview and outlook on life's purpose, and it's not what it's advertised to be. And the more I do this the greater the guilt and shame I feel for going against what Leaders and family have said about avoiding those things. 

I'm a mental mess right now. And these are the main factors contributing to it. And there remain only 2 options for me. Continue being crushed in silence, and maintain the peace others get from my meeting their needs, or get therapy and counseling and focus on myself for a while and disrupt the life I've constructed or rather had constructed for me.

I feel like I have no say and can't do what I want with my life, get the mental help I feel like I need, and at the same time am the cause of these issues because I'm imperfect and can't sustain the things I'm obligated or supposed to believe and or uphold.  

This isn't very well articulated or fully clear. I'm very frustrated and feeling hopeless as I write this.

I'm 31 and never had a conventional job due to my mental health but now I'm thinking about getting something part time I hope this is okay to post here. Long post ahead, TL;DR at the end. So, I turned 31 recently, about a year after I quit the only job I’ve ever had once and for all. On and off since I turned 18 I’ve done various forms of online only sex work. It was difficult to stay consistent with, in recent years, and never made enough for me to live on my own (I lived with my mom until I married my husband in 2017). On top of just getting sick of it and the market becoming incredibly oversaturated I also came out as trans a few years ago, hence, the nail in that coffin—at least until I start HRT and get top surgery but God only knows when I’ll be able to do either of those things.

I felt like I was doing okay just being a homemaker over the last year but I’m becoming restless, bored and concerned about my Husband and I’s future. He does have a pension but obviously I don’t and we have no savings. He’s British and getting my visas to allow me to live with him was VERY expensive and we’re still paying that off as well as other things. It’s getting better, we’re not in dire straits or anything, far from it. He makes enough to support both of us but I know that must be so much pressure on him to be the sole bread winner. In the past when he’s been unable to work we had to rely on money from his dad.

Reasons why I am extremely hesitant to start applying for jobs:

·        Biggest one, I’m disabled. I was on disability benefits before I moved here for my ADHD, anxiety, depression, and (misdiagnosed) bipolar disorder. I wasn’t entitled to benefits on my previous visas, I \*could\* claim now but they literally just changed the rules for PIP, making me ineligible, and to be honest I would feel disingenuous applying for benefits. I’m doing much better now, I don’t struggle to get out of bed or take showers anymore but I do still class myself as disabled.

·        I have plantar fasciitis and standing for longer than an hour causes me severe pain. I have self-referred to podiatry to get more intense treatment for this. I know this is probably going to be my biggest impediment.

·        I have social anxiety/am recovering from agoraphobia and the idea of dealing with people on a daily basis makes me want to rip my skin off.

·        I have NO IDEA what to put on a CV. I graduated high school in America and that’s it. I have no other certifications. I know how to use Microsoft word. I used to spend my time drawing, writing novels and doing music production, ideally I would be a full time video game composer but the last 10 years of my life were spent battling mental illness and moving across the world so to build my portfolio back up would take a lot of time and money, hence the wanting a part time job to help pay towards that.

·        I can’t drive. I think it’s actually illegal for me anyway because I have poor eyesight and a lazy eye.

Thank you so much to anyone who replies to this.

I’ve had a Psychiatrist (nurse practitioner) for the past 2 years and she has been very attentive to my needs. However I’ve been having some doubts. 

My meds have steadily been increasing dosage.

Lately, I’ve been incredibly tired, feeling like I’m in limbo. But I’ve also been really busy and don’t really have much time to relax during the day). I’m also an active person and it’s been increasingly difficult to do anything. 

Medications I am on: 150mg of Zoloft (recently upped dosage), 50mg of Hydroxizine for sleep (recently added Trazodone as well after mentioning the hydroxizine doesn’t always work), and 15mg of adderall (recently upped because 10 wasn’t working)
- i also have low dose lorazepam from my doctor for severe situations and propranolol for heart flutters that I don’t take often 
- I take a statin because I showed high cholesterol recently and I take birth control

My mom 48F has had a lot of experience with medication and expressed concern. She said my speech sounded slurred and lethargic over the phone (this was during my workday). I don’t always take her advice on these things(she frequently recommends natural remedies or meditation which has never worked for me) but I’m growing more concerned.

What can I do next, to help myself out of this hole? Hello,

I've been through a lot in my life. 30, male. A lot of sadness and anger which I gotten over with the help of my brother, 2 best friends and girlfried. Just by talking. And drinking a lot.

I had high blood pressure on new year's this year. Like ER needed high blood pressure. Which lowered with close to zero medication. I am taking meds for high blood pressure for the last 25 years. Yup, genetics suck. Since this happened I stopped drinking ALMOST completely (I drink a glass or 2 of wine every week or so) and I lost 8 kg (and still counting) and I started cycling/walking almost every day. In 3 months it got slowly better. When I need to talk about it my girlfriend is there for me. Or my brother or my friends. 

However, I am afraid of drinking alcohol or anything that gets me hyped or raises my heart rate, which is most of the stuff I did before (billiards, drinking with friends, etc.). So I changed my lifestyle. 

Then my dad suffered a brain stroke, which is caused by... high blood pressure. So my panic and mental health took a swing like never before. This is fear I'm dealing with. Which is completely new to me, not anger and not sadness. So I went to a psychotherapist and realized it's not for me. He did point out some interesting stuff, like how come coffee doesn't irritate me or smoking, which is also bad for blood pressure. It's like I'm selecting what is bad for me and isn't.

I've been to my doctor and she said my blood pressure is high from past mental issues. I know I've had them but I've always tried to solve them. Because that's how I'm built, to always find a solution.

i find it very strange how they can just share their thoughts and what they are feeling with their families and friends.

I’ve been struggling with my mental health for years, but right now feels like one of the worst episodes I’ve ever had. I think I’m in the middle of a major depressive episode, and everything feels unbearably heavy.

Recently, I accepted a loan because I was trying to make ends meet—but I ended up defaulting on it. The shame and guilt I feel about that has been eating me alive. I feel like I’ve failed at something that shouldn’t have been that hard, and it's making me feel like the worst person in the world.

On top of that, I’m withdrawing from Prozac, and the emotional swings are brutal. One minute I’m numb, the next I’m sobbing, and then it’s just… emptiness. I don’t feel like I’m handling any of this. Financially, I’m completely in a ditch, and I don’t know how to climb out.

Honestly, it feels like it would be easier to just not be here. I’m not saying that to be dramatic—I’m saying it because that’s where my head has been lately. I know deep down that I want to find a way through this, but right now, I’m struggling to see how.

I’m not looking for pity—I just need to be real and say that I’m not okay. If anyone else has been here and made it through, I’d love to know how. Or if you’re going through something similar, maybe we can just not feel so alone in it together.

Boundaries not only show respect for someone which everyone deserves regardless of any situation/circumstance. If you acknowledge yourself as the “bigger” and “mature” person you would obviously know that showing respect towards others not only means showing respect to others but to yourself. Example a father respecting his daughter is equal to a daughter respecting her father. If it’s unbalanced there isn’t a good relationship. You as a parent teach and guide your children. Instead of acting like nothing is your fault and most pushing most of the responsibilities onto your children (as if we’re equal) then turning around and demanding respect from your children as if you’re above them these actions show dysfunctionality and confuses the child. Not only does it Shows lack of communication. It shows that you’re unwilling to understand your fault in the matter and basically just causing a problem and asking other to fix it on your own terms and your term are biases to protect your ego. 

I get frustrated and act mean and rude to protect myself. I act like this because this how I observed how to communicate my feelings/emotions. And all you see is how I act, cry and scream instead of listening to what I’m saying. I’m knocking on a shut door. You expect me to change but if I change and swallow my pride and tell you what you want to be told. Then it doesn’t fix the problem I just loose my humanity and respect for myself because I’m no longer a human with free will I’m just a robot that’s here to please you. That’s why I get tot mad. I’m aware of how I affect others but why should I even try anymore if you don’t respect me enough to care how I feel. You just shutdown and close/slam doors. If I do the same I’m the problem now. Pricilla shut the door in my face no problem because I didn’t care but if I shut the door all the sudden that’s bad. No I just did the same thing. If I repeat verbatim the same words and sentences you say to me that’s bed and terrible all the sudden it’s “teenage hormones” and are you on your “period” these are things bullies say not your own father and older sister two people I care most about hurt me the most. It’s not fair. I’m the bad person the second I mirror you. It made me understand that you guys aren’t as good as you guys say you are. 
For god sake I tried to kill myself you made me write an apology letter to your fucking crazy as gf so I could go to a different country and get treated like shit by others. I don’t get a fucking break. You guys make me regret not ending it all. The same person that made me back away from killing myself turned into a horrible person the next day and for the rest of the week treated me like shit turned the narrative on me and because I can’t speak the language of people in that country that good I was made to be the bad person. All because I finally stood up for myself for the first time in along time.

I feel like a burden dad I ask you to look at test results you were supposed to look at a month ago or two. I had to be persistent because it was a test for strep throat. You got mad at me for just asking three times for you to check. I’ve been still pretty sick for a month or two which causes me to be really exhausted all the time. I know parents that would go to the ends of the earth for there kids but you literally would barely do the bare minimum because your excuse is “I’m too old” “I’m supposed to be retired now” age plays no role in the role of caring and being a parent. You paint yourself and mold your appearance to appear like this widow that’s left with burdens and you try your hardest but you try at all in making your own children feel loved. You said the reflection of my room is a reflection of my mind. My room is a reck because my mind is. I struggle with my dad being a bully. I bullied constantly yelled at pick on/apart. I’m made feel worthless and guilty of my existence. You know I struggle really bad depression I’ve had for most of my life and suicide. Yet you don’t care enough. 

Don’t be surprised if I cut contact for a couple of years for a mental break. Everyday is a struggle mentally just living with you. You’re a big baby that demands everything. You give back the bare minimum. You threaten to kick me out already. I have so many disadvantages because of having a parent like you. It’s really tough. I only feel three emotions numbness, pain, and anger. None of these are positive this is the atmosphere you’ve built the relationship you’ve spit on. It’s literally only ever okay well you feel bad. Your only justification to treat people like this is “I’m older””I’m your dad””other people would treat you worse” backing me into a corner. Am I your enemy or your fucking daughter. You act like I fucking screwed your life over just breathing and existing. How the fuck do you treat something like this. What the fuck did I do to deserve this.

No — what I experienced was racism and rudeness, plain and simple. I am not stupid; I know the difference. This is not my first time living far from my family, and they have no idea what it feels like to be treated unfairly and looked down upon simply because of my race and religion.

What hurt me the most is that they asked for my family’s contact information, and I explicitly told them not to disclose anything about my suicidal thoughts. They agreed — but later, I found out they went ahead and shared my personal information without my consent. I regret trusting them, because now my parents are emotionally distressed, worrying about me from afar. I had already explained that the reason I did not want them involved is because my parents are elderly, and I did not want to cause them unnecessary pain.

And to make matters worse, the information they used to justify their actions is simply not valid. There is no proof whatsoever that I had any pills or medication for suicide. I only had suicidal thoughts, and I never took any action or purchased anything. So stop spreading false information.

Then they threatened me, saying that if similar concerns arise again, my studies might be interrupted — even though again, they have no solid evidence. All of this is based on a false report from someone I do not even know. I suspect that person may have blackmailed me or purposely tried to get me in trouble.

I do not have many friends here. And if those people consider themselves my “friends,” they should have spoken to me directly first, or at least asked if I needed help. Not just made a phone call and suddenly had the police show up at my flat out of nowhere.

But it never got to a point where I couldn’t handle it or where my functioning was impacted. 

One day this December, my anxiety spiraled. I turned 21 around this time. I had a simple headache that night and I was somehow convinced I had meningitis. I absolutely could not deal with it and it felt like I was losing my mind. Then the next day, I was convinced I had appendicitis. And throughout the weeks, I never felt normal again. Anxiety ruled my life and I forgot how being calm felt. It was quite literally like a switch flipped overnight and i was no longer myself.

Then the depression got worse. Months of feeling miserable and absolutely hopeless. Self harm became something I felt like I needed rather than a harmful coping mechanism. I got really irritable and upset at the people around me. I lost any aspirations for the future and anything positive.

I have never been able to be happy. I tried drugs and alcohol and spent 15 years wasted away. Somehow, I decided to get clean, and that process was the only time I was really happy. Once I got stable again, I immediately started feeling down. It is like I am only happy when things are destroyed and need to be rebuilt or chaotic and need to be organized. 

I have clawed my way back from the depths of hell back to a seemingly successful life countless times in countless cities across the US. I find myself in a new town, I make new friends, I crash and burn, and then I disappear. I imagine there are at least 3 dozen people wondering where the fuck I went. I tend to just back my bags and start driving.

 I always figured that someday it would become too much and I would jump off a bridge or shoot myself. 

Last year I had the most painful experience of my life, and I fell into a deep depression. I knew it was finally time. I had a friend come over. I told him I was going to be in my bedroom for a while, and I asked him to leave me alone. 

I downed a bottle of strong benzos, enough to put me out for a few hours ( and maybe even kill me ), climbed inside a garbage bag with 6.6 liters on nitrous oxide, and went to sleep. 

I woke up in the hospital with third degree burns ( from the freezing cold nitrous tanks ) all over my hands, my neck. My friend said he couldn't let me go through with it. He came into my room to try to wake me,  but I was blue and gray. He called the rescue and they saved me. 

For a little while this gave me a mission again. I wished he had let me die. But I figured maybe he save me for a reason. So I decided to try to get better. 

I have been in therapy ever since. I finally told my therapist I would tell her the truth as long as she didn't have me committed. I told her I think about suicide all day every day. I do not currently have a plan, and I am trying to get better again. 

It has been 8 months since I got out of the hospital from my suicide attempt. I was in the hospital recovering for over a month. Again,x I am having dark thoughts every day. I posted on here that I was going to end it all again the first week of April. But I didnt do it. I am back to where I used to be. Someday, I know life will hurt too much again and I will do it.

I’ve lived with a deep, persistent anger for most of my life. It was constant — sometimes explosive, but mostly just always there, simmering beneath everything. I spent years in therapy trying to work through it. Every therapist I saw said I was incredibly self-aware. I knew all the tools — mindfulness, reframing, CBT, grounding. But no matter how much insight I had, nothing ever touched the core of what I was feeling. That baseline agitation just never went away.

Until recently — when I started treating my physical health.

I was dealing with chronic issues: MCAS, SIBO, restless legs, histamine intolerance, extreme fatigue. In the process of trying to survive all that, I started working on my gut. I added probiotics (especially L. Reuteri) and Life Extension Saffron for mood support — not expecting much.

And out of nowhere, that lifelong irritability started to lift.
The static in my system quieted. I didn’t feel like I was constantly battling myself. I didn’t need to regulate — I was just… okay.

It hit me: all this time, my issue wasn’t just psychological. It was biological.
Chronic inflammation. Microbial imbalance. Nervous system dysfunction.
And therapy, as valuable as it can be, never touched any of that — because most therapists aren’t trained to look there.

Two separate therapists even told me:

“Most of my clients think they have hard lives, but they’re stuck in their own loops. You actually have a hard life. You’ve faced homelessness, serious illness, and you care for a profoundly disabled child. You’re doing everything right — and life just keeps throwing more at you.”

They could see I wasn’t the problem. But they still didn’t have the tools to help.

The reality is:
Our biology is almost completely overlooked in mental health care.
And if you’ve been through real trauma — medical, social, or environmental — no amount of mindfulness will override a body that’s stuck in survival mode.

What’s worse is that most of us have to figure this out ourselves. No guide. No clear answers. Just years of trial and error, trying different things and hoping something works — while being told it’s all in your head.

So if you’re stuck, even after years of therapy, journaling, introspection, self-awareness — I highly recommend looking at your biology.

Start with the basics that helped me:
	•	Life Extension Saffron (incredibly calming and uplifting)
	•	L. Reuteri or a trusted probiotic
	•	Support your gut, lower inflammation, and see what shifts.

Because sometimes, it’s not about your thoughts.
It’s about your system.
And when your body finally feels safe — your mind can too.

I'm probably what some would call ""functioning"", as in I have a job, a somewhat stable relationship and most people do not know or detect I'm depressed. I also have only occasional self-hurting tendencies and as far as I remember lately no self-ending tendencies.

In these twelve years it hasn't been easier to predict when my symptoms are going to get better or worse. I know some things help me personally like sport or hanging out with friends, but those things are also able to send me back into a spiralling loop of depression. 

Anyway I've recently been doing ""well"", or as I like to see it: I've been feeling again. Not just the good stuff, but also the bad stuff. It's like a fog has been lifted. It's like my heart is exposed, like I am vulnerable to all small cuts and hits coming at me, unlike my usual self where everything feels numb.

These are both the best moments for me and the worst. They're the best because I feel like improving my life, I feel like showing my vulnerability to people I care about, I feel like showing my emotions, I feel like going out of my comfort zone, meet people, see new things, take risks, get hurt, feel.

They're the worst because I know it's very temporary and in a few days I'll be back into the fog. And whatever I do won't change this. Wherever I try to run to I'll be back in the fog. My chance at a better future are limited by the short time I've got before I lose all willpower and hide back inside my mental cave.

I (21F) am going through the hardest time of my life, and I have never hated myself more. I just found out I got fired from my new job as a restaurant server. I called out of work 5 times in my first 3 weeks, or 5 out of my first 16 days. I couldn’t bring myself to go to those shifts or even get out of bed. 

I was diagnosed with bipolar II a few months ago. My previous diagnoses were PTSD, anxiety, and depression. 

Lately it feels like I’m losing my mind, and I’m at the mercy of chemicals bouncing around in my brain. I’m embarrassed, and frustrated, and confused, and most of all tired.

I am currently on academic leave from college because I got so depressed I failed 2 classes. My friends in my year are graduating next month, and I can’t even hold down a basic job. I can’t get a grip on myself. I’ve been spending recklessly, having extreme mood swings, and experiencing suicidal ideation. I’ve been feeling like there is nothing good about me, and the world would be better off without me. I know it’s not true, but it’s still scary. 
 
My family situation has always been rough, but in these past months it’s the worst it’s ever been. My mom ran away and was sleeping out of her car for weeks, my dad’s been drinking and driving late every other night, and he got in a car crash last week. He gets drunk and threatens to kill himself if I turn out a failure. I’m terrified and anxious, I break down sobbing some days for no tangible reason. 

When I look back, I genuinely think I’ve been depressed since I was ten years old and my birth mom died. I have addictive tendencies and do anything for mindless gratification, distraction, because I’m always sad and agitated. I was completely dependent on weed throughout college, still sometimes am, and I’ve started the habit of drinking alone at night. 

I don’t know how it got this bad, but I’m genuinely worried that I won’t ever get out of this hole I seem to be sinking deeper into. 

My parents are disappointed in me, my family is falling apart because everyone is abusive and hates each other, and I can’t even function. It feels like something broke in me several years ago, and I simply have nothing left to give. I don’t want anyone to ask anything of me, I just want to self-isolate.

Please give me any thoughts, advice, and encouragement. Thanks for reading",Negative,Low Concern,my new job as,"(43.421215114736604, -71.98345251484122)",43.421215114736604,-71.98345251484122

I don't just want to stay in bed, I want to stare at the wall for hours. I've always assumed this was normal, as on those days I still have small happy moments.

But, yesterday, it got bad. The day started off decent, and out of nowhere the only thing I could think about was how dull life was. Everything was irritating- but not in an angry way, more as in a jealous way. Everything around me felt like a tool for jealously. The pot on the stove- lucky to be inanimate. The kids playing down the street, lucky to feel joy. 

I don't think I realized how bad it was until I was sitting on my bathroom floor gasping. I couldn't breathe- and this isn't the first time it has happened; but it was the first time I ever actually picked up a razor. I'd thought about it sure- but have always brushed it off as stupid. So the fact that I felt so persuaded to watch my blood pool around me- scared me. A friend ended up talking me out of it as I called them in a panic- but I immaturely thought the feeling would be gone by now. 

Usually my ""episodes"" only last a day at most, never any longer. I'm confused? Everything still feels dull. I've found myself losing focus very easily, and dazing off more than usual. I felt so happy this morning, having lunch with my friends; but somehow that feeling is gone already, and I'm staring off again.  ",Positive,Low Concern,,"(None, None)",,

Hi, 17M here. So, for context, i grew up being an awkward chubby nerdy kid for thirteen years of my life. Needless to say i spent most of my life being a hugless, kissless virgin. After a heartbreak i decided that i was going to lock in and become a better man. I lost a shit ton of weight, started talking to girls more often, all that.  
Going straight to the point; I am now 17. I don't mean to brag about ANYTHING i'm about to say but i'm 6'4, lean, slightly muscular, i consider my face to be at least kinda good(I like my jawline and my eyes), i try my best to be an interesting person to talk to(I'm a great listener, i like to elevate the person i'm interacting with, show interest about her likings and etc) and i try my best in general to be an organized, good looking and nice guy in general.  
Thing is, i'm still single. As a matter of fact, i never had a girlfriend. I used to have hookups and girls into me quite often, but now i can't even get that. Every time that i try to hookup or just straight up try to be friends or something with a girl i'm just met with stone cold replies, straight up ghosting or lovebombing or even just a flat out unfollow for no reason.  
This loneliness is one of the main reasons for my current pseudo-depressive state. I feel like so much of a wreck that my father offered me the number of a hooker today and i just felt flat out disgusting and ashamed of myself. Like, i'm 17 and i can't even have something with a girl for more than a week?  
I know most of you will say that i'm young and that i shouldn't worry about that, etc. I know, teenage dating is kinda dumb, but at the same time i can't help but feel like a giant manbaby. I'll be 18 in a few months, i don't know how to properly love someone, i don't know how to channel my feelins and i never had real solid dating/emotional management experience.  
To be fair i see myself living a single life until my mid 20's and that is depressing and comforting at the same time.  
At the end of the day i think i just could experience teenage love for once.",Positive,Low Concern,,"(None, None)",,

I ended up relapsing in $h and it’s literally the only thing I can think of that I look forwards to.

It's held back my life more than anything else. It's a poison and I hate that I can feel my insides rotting away from years of mourning the person I'm not. I'm 31 M and live in London. When I graduated university, I did a masters that my parents helped me fund. That whole year I was incredibly depressed. I drank and smoked weed most nights and hated my degree and felt I was not doing the right thing.

Then I graduated with a masters in history with no prospects or any idea what I wanted to with my life. At this point the depression hit me full in the face. To escape my addictions and myself, I went to Asia to teach English. There I alienated all the other teachers, drank every night. No drugs, but I made up for that with alcohol.

While in Asia, I learned about Bitcoin. It genuinely excited me. I thought if I could make money without needing to speak to people I'd be able to ""win"". I left Asia after 6 months and came back to my parents place. Here my depression hit me again and I realised it had never left, I was drinking to mask it. I lay in bed for around 6 months in the darkest depression of my life.

I managed to get a temp summer job and started taking sertraline. I felt slightly better. My colleagues found me difficult to work with and took a dislike to me. This has been a recurring theme in my work life. People don't like me. I present autistic traits. I'm either too quiet or too opinionated. I want to die. I'm stuck between the two poles of my personality — the man who says nothing and makes people uncomfortable, or the man who smashes down his mask and lunges in with a stupid comment for the sake of being seen to say something.

I’m weary of my insecurities and feel frazzled, bored, and like I’ve been stretched out and dried in the sun.

Anyway, I got into crypto marketing. That's been my job for the last few years and I hate it. I hate the industry, I hate the market, I hate the tech and I hate that I've effectively become a snake oil salesmen. Over the last 5 years, I've worked for like 6 different companies. Again, people tend to dislike me and I find it hard to keep my shit together for long. I have a couple of months where I'm okay, and then all of a sudden the depression hits me and I'm fucked again. I stop caring at work. I take liberties with my work, I start backsliding, drinking in the week, smoking every day. Recently I've cut down a lot on all that, but I still feel the same, and it reminds me why I was doing it in the first place.

I'm just so sick of myself, my career is in ruins, my girlfriend is losing patience with me, my parents don't know what to say anymore. I've had so many fights with them where I've just flown off the handle and said awful hurtful things that have alienated me from them. I know they love me, but I also know I'm not easy to be around. At this point, I'm struggling to find hope. I have no optimism for the future. It's flying by me, one hazy day at a time. And now fuck, I'm 31, when the fuck did that happen?

I went to see a friend recently who's also been out of work the last couple of months. In that times he'd created a video game and collaborated with a mutual friend who has written the music for it. I'm in awe of this, how has he sat down and managed to work day after day on that? What is that drive and why don't I have the same thing inside me? If I try and do anything, like learn piano or to do some writing, it's like I talk myself out of it before I can get the ball rolling. I'll just revert to moronic passivity, staring at pixels on screens and saturating my mangled brain with more useless and pointless knowledge.

I don't know what to do. I can't go on like this. I need work and I can't even get a shitty crypto job like I could a couple of years ago. The pay is decent, I just hate thinking and writing about crypto after years of it.

So all in all, I'm sick of it all. Life, work, and myself most of all. I have a therapy session booked for tomorrow and I hope it helps but I'm not holding my breath.",Negative,High-Risk,London,"(51.5074456, -0.1277653)",51.5074456,-0.1277653

I used to have like manic episodes but those slowly die down as I aged, now it’s mostly just straight depression.

I view everything around me as fake. Fake staged interactions.Like a classmate and her mom walking past me in the elementary school lobby during . Their clothes and style and pace and the timing chosen intentionally - like they were probing for info.

Like they tried to place certain images or notions of themselves in my head, then later set up fake interactions to try and test what they were.

Thoughts like this ruined my life. They paralyzed me. I had nowhere to go. Nobody to talk to. All I ever saw, all I ever see - is evidence pointing towards being stuck in an experiment.

I either live a fake life, where people can treat me like shit and lie to me forever. Or I kill myself.

I’ve never had any real friends or dates. I tried dating once - after years of avoiding people who clearly fucking lying to me all the god damn time.

And every single person was exactly who I thought they were. The person I was “dating” was just collaborating with people from my past to set up fake interactions.

All my “friends” were just there setting me up for fake interactions and talking shit to myself in a vieled manner like I wouldn’t notice, my family was constantly lying to me.

It’s like they wanted me to erupt, so they could offer a bunch of evidence to why I was wrong, and they could continue their plan.

Even if I could escape, which I can’t, I am nobody with nothing. I’m not good at my job, I don’t really care about my job, I’m not good at sports (people used to just let me win for their own agenda), I don’t really care about sports, no hobbies, the experience of just going outside is just awful.

When there is nobody it feels empty and even more isolating somehow. When there are people it can send me into a bit of a paranoia and I get uncomfortable in my own skin.

These things get worse every year.

And the stupidest thing of it all - if I could go back with all I know, I still couldn’t find a way to be happy. I would not be able to do the things they want, and have the type of people I want in my life.

I would not be able to force an honest relationship with my friends. I would not be able get friends who weren’t lying to me all the time. It would not be possible.

So now I don’t live, I just bask in the lie. I’m tired of doing it to myself. I’m tired of tricking myself into seeing pathways to reaching an understanding. I’m tired of waiting until I’m older or good enough for it to make sense.

Was hospitalized after wanting to attempt with my anti-depressants (now I know that obviously wouldn’t work). I’m now 26 and have thought about killing myself or not being here anymore almost everyday ever since. I’ve tried dozens of medications and combinations over the years, hundreds of counseling appointments, and nothing helps.

I’ve been having issues with migraines and IBS ever since I was assaulted by a family member, it worsens with stress or anxiety. I’ve missed weeks and weeks of work because of these issues and I feel absolutely useless. I’m a burden to all my loved ones even if they deny it and have been ostracized from the rest of the family for calling out my assaulter. 

Nothing ever works for helping my mental health and I think it’s because I’m just not supposed to be here and I was never meant to be alive. I can’t rationalize it any other way despite mulling it over with counselors. It’s so expensive to even try to get care and there goes all my little money.

But it's possible.
I don't recognize the person I was 5 years ago. 

I made a new reddit account and before doing so I went through my old posts and comments on my old account to remove anything identifying or that I just didn't want floating around online anymore. I was absolutely shocked by how bad my depression was when I was last consistently active on reddit. There was a rage and despair that seeped out of everything I wrote, even topics that had nothing to do with mental health. I was miserable and didn't even realize how bad it was until I reached a very dark place. 

That was about 5 years ago. 

I am in a completely different place. I still struggle with depression and anxiety (the anxiety is kind of taking the lead lately). But I'm doing so much better and I have been for a long time. And I didn't have to blow up my life to do it. I made some medium changes. I held myself and others accountable. I learned a lot and made a lot of mistakes.

I was diagnosed with MDD and OCD years ago. I put myself in thousands of dollars in debt trying to seek help and it didn't work. 

I was put on welbutrin, Lexapro, zoloft, abilify, Prazosin, then maxed out Prozac. When I told my dr that I felt like I was losing my mind and felt like I was seeing things that weren't there all he did was write down a little note. He didn't say anything to me. He didn't offer to chnage medication. He didn't say that i needed to chnage something in therapy. He just wrote a physical note and didn't even look at me. It was this moment that I realized that he didn't care. That I was just a dollar sign to him. So I stopped taking my meds. And stopped going. 

 I feel the same. I feel like im going insane. I feel alone. I feel like I have no one to talk to. I feel like im being watched. I'm crumbling. I can't sleep. I can't eat. I have break downs every night weather I'm home or at work. I can't function anymore. I want to stop hurting inside. I want to make everything stop. 

But I cant. Because if I mess up and live through a suicide attempt I will dround in medical bills and psych bills. I will only be alive and working to pay them. And as fucked up as it is i scheduled another psych appointment. 

I am hoping this one treats me more like a person and less like a paycheck. I'm desperate. I know they will recomend therapy but I've already done 7 years of therapy. And therapy doesn't work for me. 

Im desperate to feel better. But I know i won't. And if his round of pills and therapy and everything doesn't work I don't know what to do. 

I really feel like life is pointless and just a cycle of winning other people pockets. No one would care if I did just dissappear because even then my life insurance would pay my family. 

I feel like I live in a forever feever dream and my actual existence is just to make other people money. Living and breaking is painful. 

I am scared. I am hallucinating. I am having compulsions. I have panic attacks to the point my chest hurts and I get tunnel vision. I dread waking up in the morning. 

Going to a hospital isn't an option because they dont help. So I'm alone. All fucking alone right now. And im to tired.

After developing major depression due to excessive work stress, I quit my job and spent my days lying in bed, suffering.  
My father, heartbroken by my illness, promised to support me financially for a year so that I could focus on recovery, for which I am deeply grateful.  
Now three years have passed, and I'm still living the same way - lying in bed every day, with no motivation, no interests, living each day in pain.

Recently, due to the global stock market crash, my father called to tell me that we're facing financial difficulties, and because of his chronic illness, he needs to save money for emergencies.  
Since being diagnosed with major depression, I've been trying to tell myself that I'm not a burden to my family - I'm just sick. I tell myself this because I know many patients commit suicide due to the guilt of being ill, but suicide would devastate my family, so I try to tell myself that just staying alive is enough.

But lately, due to the reality of financial pressure, I have to acknowledge that I am indeed a burden - my family is sad, distressed, losing money, and losing their right to enjoy retirement.  
I promised my father on the phone that I would find a job soon, but after hanging up, I couldn't stop crying because I don't feel ready - maybe I'll never be ready to return to work. I'm in so much pain, so uncomfortable, and I want to leave this world.  
How can I work in this condition? I don't know, but I know I must work now. I've been crying all day, even while writing this post. Perhaps I'm crying because I finally have to face the cruel reality - I have to return to work while still battling this illness.

I can't afford a therapist right now so unfortunately that isn't feasible for me. 
I'm not sure what the cause actually is but my mind is painfully foggy all the time. It is so bad that I struggle to have basic conversations and complete simple tasks. I can't seem to remember anything at all and I am so slow. It's incredibly humiliating, even the most obvious things go over my head and I feel completely incompetent. It feels like my brain is stuffed with cotton. Absolutely everything feels overwhelming and I find myself wondering how people are able to do it all. I am struggling. I don't understand how people can work, do school, look put together, maintain a relationship, do household chores, socialize, have hobbies, exercise, have a meal plan, run errands etc. and they seem to do all of this well too!! 
I've never struggled to get good grades in school growing up and I even took some college classes in high school. I'm doing well in college right now (although it feels very overwhelming to keep up with). I also work a job and have a relationship but I live at home still. I just feel like such an air head to the point where it's genuinely concerning. I've had people tease me all throughout my life that I'm weird or r*tarded. I wonder if I have some sort of undiagnosed intellectual disability or if I'm neurodivergent. I feel like a childish adult who can't take care of themself. 
This brain fog is affecting my mental health very negatively. If this is such a struggle for me now I don't know how much longer I can keep up. I also worry that I'll never have friends or I won't be able to maintain my relationship. It's an incredibly anxiety inducing feeling. I feel like I'm drowning from doing the absolute bare minimum. 
It's making me feel like I'm a failure or that everyone is looking down on me. I feel like others pity me or see me as immature. I'm just so embarrassed. 
For the majority of my life I've been deeply and chronically depressed so maybe that has contributed. I also worry about how much weed I was smoking at around 16. I was smoking from an illicit cart too and I worry if it was laced or contaminated with heavy metals. I'm not sure what it is but I just feel hopeless. 
I'm sorry for such a negative and jumbled post!! If you're reading this I hope you're doing well.

Things were good and i used to indulge in every thing play football (Soccer) a lot and I used to be good at it as kid. All that i could say is I was a happy child, but when I was 6-7 years old, there used to be a cat in our house who gave birth to two kittens, we used to feed those kittens and i used to play with them a lot. But one day I don't know what happened to me or what was going through me, those kittens were hiding behind the cupboard and i pulled them out(i might miss out a lot of details because this is a vivid memory that I have of it) they weren't going on well with me so i killed them( i know this is very bad thing to do and i feel very sad about it, and also me being sad about it wouldn't bring them back to life) and one of the reasons i want to die, and after a while like when I was between 9-10 i was exposed to pornography by my cousin who was way older than me whom I was very close to, he showed me what porn is and told me this brings us pleasure, he held my hand and placed it on his weiner and asked me to rub it off, i didn't realise what he was doing then, and then he turned me the other side with my back facing towards him and took my pants down and penetrated me. This happened a lot of times and i totally did not understand what he was doing and told him many times I don't like it, and this kept happening until I was 17 and i realised he was assaulting me at 15, he used to say it's very common for guys to do this, and I'm not supposed to say it to anyone. I can't tell anyone too because no one would believe me and they are very very close to us, that it would break the family of something like this is spoken out, and i decided not to tell anyone about it and kept it to myself, and i left it, he moved to another country now, i still talk to him. This is another reason, and I'm basically very ugly looking and never had someone like me, never really had a girlfriend after 18(i used to have a girlfriend in 3rd grade but it doesn't really count) I'm very skinny, very ugly and i don't see anyone being attracted to me, i have health conditions like arthritis. As I grew up i realised that I'm not good at anything, that I do not have a single talent, i can't run good, I'm not good at singing, I'm just really not good at anything, and slowly i started losing interest in things, things that used to make me happy, i don't find happiness in anything now, and i started developing self hatred, I hated the way i look, I hated what i saw at the mirror. I hated my existence. I'm bad at academics, I'm was an average kid from the beginning. I fear i could never really chase the dreams that I had when I was 9, the last time I felt happy was when Messi won the world cup with Argentina back in 2022( id literally would have killed myself if he hadn't won) i feel very lonely, I don't have the need to be in a relationship with someone but i somehow feel the want of having one, i want emotional connection with someone, i want intimacy with someone, in short i want to be loved, i want someone to be proud of me, i want to make people proud.

There are lots of layers to this story that I don't want to get into, but I want to get a grip onto my life, but there's just so much I can't overcome. I am slowly realising more and more that I'm losing myself. My little sister nowadays acts like I did back then, having a cool head in conversation and being supportive. I think like this as well, but my feelings are just full of anger, someone shows me love or support and my feeling response is that I want to run against a wall or punch something. And when I see her i just wish I could be like that again. I still try to be supportive but i realise I'm not helpful to anyone. 

My boyfriend is a sweetheart but he's carrying a big load on his own, and he still supports me, but whenever he needs support I feel so subpar, he asked me what we do if we get tired of each other and that feels like he's already getting tired of me slowly. At the same time he wants to move together but I don't know if i can do that, we're quite far apart and I have an old cat and I'm scared he won't survive, he's my lifeline. 

Because I can't keep my feelings in check I've not been reaching out to my two last friends, and I know I should really do that. But they're depressed and have difficults life's on their own and I know I'd just drag them down. 

I'm trapped in my own work hell, I've never tried to learn something, and now I'm feeling like I'm in no state to learn something and even if. I really really don't know what. I'm currently learning another language and that's fun, but if I look into the future I dont know what I want to become or do with myself. I just wish I could take the suffering from the people around me, each of them had such hard lives already. I know i should find someone to talk about this, all the layers. 

Is everyone depressed in some way? Everyone I met and who's close to me had some horrible experiences in their lifes to the point that that left a mark on their souls and/or bodies.

Apparently we had quietly noticed each other during MMO raids, and we both kinda enjoyed each others company before she suddenly contacted me privately and things escalated quickly from there. Maybe too quickly. I wasnt prepared for it and got too attached to her too quickly. 

She is suffering from anxiety and depression, but she considered me a safe point in her life up to a few weeks ago when i overwhelmed her with pressure of my own feelings and plans for our future.. too big plans. Way too much for her to handle.. i was in a too big emotional state to realize when she tried telling me it was too much, and she was getting overwhelmed.. even if for my part it was all said from a standpoint of wanting to love and care for her, and to help her.

Now she has been withdrawn for over a week. I have taken the time to actually study depression to figure out where i went wrong, and have done what i can to give her space to recover..

She has sent me a few selfies after, and a few short texts, but the last few days they feel colder and more distant. 

Beneath the depression she is a very loving, caring and awesome person. I am deeply in love with her still. I really wish i understood her condition better before this happened, but we were locked in a maelstrom of love and passion, and i didnt realize what i was doing to her before it was suddenly too late...

Now that I have dropped out I’m scared that without school my brain is going to rot away and I’ll become even more unintelligent than I already am

I tried therapy last year in my Senior year of high school, and I decided to drop out of it that Summer thinking things would be better and I could go back to taking my mental health into my own hands. I do not have any diagnosis nor medication nor have I ever.

I have progressively grown to have a more difficult time thinking and using my brain over the last ten months. I was never well educated or socialized growing up, so now at this point I feel like a walking zombie. I’ve always been a quiet person as I never could think of anything to add onto conversations but now it has progressively gotten worse. Even creating this post takes a lot of energy and thinking.

I just feel so lost. I don’t know what to do. 

To give some backstory on myself, I grew up with zero family members present in my life, and my mom kept me inside the house all day except for school. Then when things took a turn for the worst  at my moms, my cousin took me under her wing for a year and helped me to get my license, car, enter the workforce, etc. I was then sent back to my moms at 17 for a year till I left for college. Now I live in an apartment off-campus and I take care of myself, but I have zero family and the friends from high school I do not speak to much. Honestly I’m not sure how I even managed to make any friends from HS. I’m struggling to afford rent but I don’t have anybody i could move in with besides maybe my dad, but he’s severely mentally ill and I would feel even more suicidal living with him I think, so I’m scared I’ll have to live in my car.

Not only do i have those problems but I suffer with my sense of self. I don’t know who i am or what i like. I never had the opportunity to develop interests or hobbies growing up, and now I can’t bring myself to discover those things as getting out of bed and being present at work is just about the most I can manage. The near-zero social interaction I had for 17 years leaves me never knowing what to do or say around people, It seems like everybody always has some word or phrase they can use for any topic or object they see. I know that I can build my intelligence, train my social skills, etc. but i also know that it will take several if not more years just to feel like I might be able to communicate somewhat like everybody else. I want things to get better. I want to have a clearer state of mind. I’m scared that I’ll act on my suicidal urges soon.

Throughout my entire life I've been fighting suicidal thoughts and depression. I am a 26 year old female and for almost as long as I can remember, I've had suicidal thoughts. The last time that I can remember potentially being truly happy, I was 8 or 9 years old. I've tried to take my life on multiple occasions, and have given up more times than I can count. I want nothing more than to actually be happy, I don't want to give up, but it's so much harder than it looks. For the first time in my life, I'm kind of happy, I'm going to get married to my wonderful fiance and everything. But, even with things going better in life, I still find myself seriously considering suicide every single day. Even though I am the happiest now that I ever have been since 8 years old.

How do I stop this? What's a good way to mitigate the suicidal thoughts, or stop them all together? I've even forced myself to get into a routine and don't let myself rot in bed or rot on the couch anymore. I wake up every morning and have breakfast before work, I go to the gym everyday, I walk my dog everyday, I take care of my animals and fiance and make sure that they're all happy everyday. 

I don't understand why I'm not just happy now. I have a home, I have my animals, I have a car, job and fiance. I'm not poor and I don't entirely hate my job. But I still find myself updating suicide notes, and fighting killing myself. Mentally, I'm no where close to okay. I think about driving as fast as possible into a wall, or ending it all with my handgun, and think that everyone would be better off if I was gone. I can't muster up a single possible thought about myself, I quite honestly hate myself, my mind rattles off a million reasons why I'm a terrible person constantly. I've talked to therapists, but they're expensive, and never have any constructive thoughts on my situation. I just can't seem to flip the switch and stop hating myself, not a single day goes by where i don't seriously consider suicide.

Back in 2019 I had a bad pill problem (opiates) and was at the bar with “friends” any free time I got. After crashing MULTIPLE cars and waking up a handful of times in the back of ambulances or in emergency rooms due to overdosing I decided it was time to stop destroying myself and start going to AA meetings. I was so tired of being sick and tired. They helped for the most part until I met someone that my sponsor at the time introduced me to. He was absolutely awful to me and extremely mentally and emotionally abusive. We got in an argument one night and I left, relapsed, crashed my car on the highway and got a DUI. I feel like a cat with 9 lives. No longer having a car, I had to rely on my parents. That DUI was the last time I touched those drugs and ended up getting pregnant not long after within 3 months of knowing this guy. What I thought was the end of the world ended up being my biggest blessing. I had my daughter in August 2020 and my life changed. My priorities were different, I was a mommy. I don’t drink anymore and still don’t do pills and although my mental health isn’t always the best I truly try my best to be happy for that little girl. After about 2 years of sharing a car with my dad I ended up getting one on my own again and life was finally back on track.

This past weekend I was driving home from donating plasma (actually was on the way to the store to get stuff for my daughters Easter basket) and I rear ended someone stopped at a red light and totaled my car. Air bags deployed and hit me in the face and shins, car is mangled. I could barely get the door open to get out and fumes from whatever it was was making it hard to breathe. The other driver was thankfully okay and was able to drive away.  I wasn’t looking at my phone, just wasn’t paying attention for a moment and didn’t have enough time to stop. It instantly took me back to those days of drinking and drugging and crashing cars and getting arrested. I wanted to jump off the nearest bridge and still do. I am so completely disappointed in myself. I wasn’t even doing anything wrong this time, every other time I got in an accident in the past I was up to no good. I feel like a hopeless loser again. Not to mention, being home with my parents constantly when I am not at work makes me absolutely miserable. I love having my freedom to come and go as I please and although I’m happy to be alive I just can’t get past this.

I hate not having a car (unfortunately I didn’t have rental on my insurance) and now my mom has to bring me to and from work and bring my daughter to and from daycare. My parents only have 1 car so it’s not like I can borrow my mom’s car to do things I need to do nor would she let me. I got myself into really bad credit card debt in the last few years and my credit is BAD so even though I’ll get something back for the car for a down payment, I probably will have a hard time getting a loan. Ugh. I just don’t know what to do. Currently sitting at my desk at work crying wishing I could go back in time. I was going to go somewhere else and last minute decided not to and was going to the dollar store instead and I wish I wouldn’t have changed my mind. My sister told me she thinks I have PTSD from everything I’ve been through but I really don’t know. I just feel like everything I worked so hard for is now gone.

I'm 18M.","Feeling Lost and Stuck and Struggling with Relationships, Addiction, and My Own Identity. I'm 18M. Hey everyone,

I don’t really know where to start, but I need to get this off my chest. I’m feeling so lost, and I’ve been struggling with a lot of things lately, both mentally and emotionally. I’m hoping someone can offer some advice or insight because it’s getting hard to keep going the way things are.

To give you some context, I’ve been dealing with a lot of pressure in my relationships and life in general. I’ve been in a relationship for two years, and I love my girlfriend deeply, but I’ve been struggling with trust issues, overthinking, and some serious anxiety. I can’t seem to shake the constant doubts that plague me, especially around her loyalty, even though there’s no real reason for me to doubt her.

On top of that, I’ve been dealing with addiction, specifically smoking weed and vaping. I used to find it as a way to cope with stress and anxiety, but it’s slowly been taking a toll on my mental and physical health. I’ve been smoking way more than I should, and now it’s causing me to feel paranoid, anxious, and disconnected from reality. I know I need to stop, but I feel trapped in this cycle.

I’ve also been thinking about my past a lot lately, especially about a girl I used to be really close to. Her name is hidden for now. We used to be inseparable when we were younger. I loved her innocence, her softness, and the way she made me feel like everything was going to be okay. I used to dream about her, and there was always this deep connection between us, but I’m not sure where things went wrong. Now, when I think about her, it feels like my heart aches, and I can’t get rid of the feeling. I feel like I’m stuck in the past, unable to move forward.

I saw her yesterday and it was like a old memory, it was just like a dream or a Deja Vu. I feel like it was a sign or anything. I'm totally unsure of my mental conditions right now actually.


Lately, I’ve been struggling with my identity too. I used to be full of love and respect for everyone, but now I feel like a different person. I don’t know what happened to me. I’m battling with anger and frustration, and it feels like I’ve turned into someone I don’t even recognize anymore. The worst part is that I’ve hurt people in my life because of it.

I feel like I’m stuck in a loop. My mental health is deteriorating, I feel disconnected from everyone around me, and I don’t know how to break free. I’ve considered seeing a psychiatrist, but I don’t have the financial means for it right now. I know I need help, but I feel too weak to take that first step.

So here I am, reaching out to this community because I don’t know where else to turn. I’m looking for advice, support, or anything that can help me find a way out of this dark place. Has anyone else gone through something similar? How did you manage to break free from these patterns and rebuild your life?

I know I’m responsible for my actions, and I want to change, but it feels so hard. Please, if you’ve been through something like this, let me know how you coped.

Hello all, hope everyone is doing... meh, I guess.

I'm not young by any means so perhaps I'd like to hear from people who are deep in the darkness and have been through a lot already?

I go in and out of clinical depression (major). I went on many years without it even during a very volatile and unhealthy relationship - because we both struggled, we did end up helping each other. Also, having someone around to share your life with helps immensely...

Thing is: I had never, ever, allowed myself to share my life with anyone. I keep to myself, I like a certain degree of separation: ie, not sharing a house.
My ex was the first partner I lived with and I was already over 30 yrs old.
And they are still the love of my life. We ended up living together for a few years after breaking up to keep the friendship alive and we are truly each other's family.
The support was incredible as bumpy as it could be.

Now... they moved away. And I'm broken. Yes, I am in clinical depression but in all previous instances, I had no external factors creating it (endogenous depression). Even though this bout is endogenous, this time I feel like I have nothing to hold on to because my life's circumstances have changed so dramatically that I do not know how to go about all of this since everything around me has also changed (keep in my mind that my life only really changed after I turned 30).

Friends have all moved away. I have a very comfortable life, everything I need. But the loneliness? I had never experienced anything like this.
I've been in and out of dissociated states.
I never felt lonely because I was really good at keeping to myself and being in my little bubble. But since I've let ""someone in"" and learned how beautiful it is to let that happen... I don't know how to protect myself like I did before.
So, this time, it is breaking me apart like I never felt before.

I didn't feel loneliness. I enjoyed being alone even when suffering.
This massive shift left me without a ground. 

We're still the best of friends but there is no shoulder for me.
My friends are all gone.
The depression and the fact I keep going in and out of dissociation don't allow me to do things to ""distract myself"" like I did before. I used to immerse myself in books, movies, art, etc and that would be enough to hold on until the darkness faded away.

For the first time, I have none of the abilities that helped me before.

Yes, I'm in therapy but I'm waiting for a new one because mine retired.
Yes, I'm on meds and will make a switch in about a week to see if I can have something that works better.

I do believe (from previous experience) that when the right meds kick in, I will be better but, this time around, I will still feel lonely and sad (even if not clinically depressed).

I know that when I do feel better (I know this monster comes and goes) I will have a bit more energy to change my circumstances but while this darkness eats me up.... I don't know if my strength in knowing I'll be OK is enough not to harm myself in some way, since loneliness is key word here. I don't trust people. Very few. And I don't want to overwhelm them - it's not productive and they all have bad stuff happening too, it's not like they're available to hear me crying everyday, not should they.

When you have this mix of being absolutely alone in this world (not a fake depression belief, a real circumstance) and fight this beast, how do you go about it?

I'm sure many of you have been through this and I admire you already because I was unaware it could be this bad, even if I've been in the psych ward before because of depression. It's different now. I had never shared my life before (as in, living with someone). So.... I don't have a clue.
Thanks in advance.

I think a combination of circumstances and bad people make me not want to live anymore. 



I rent the second apartment/room in my life. 



The first landlord a businessman in his 50s, perpetually busy, after time it turned out that he drank alcohol in amounts exceeding any norm, and in addition, he chewed psychoactive subtsances. 

After two years, when he went into debt in his main business, he demanded a one-time 220% raise, which I was to pay within 2 days. 

Since raises of this amount are illegal under Polish law I refused, he began to threaten me with beatings and death. 



I moved out immediately out of fear for my life. 

Because such a quick turnaround worsened my health ( I suffer from RA) I got acute sciatica, and to this day, that is, in 3 months I cannot recover. 



The second accommodation was an apartment from a woman in her 40s, who on first contact seemed nice, friendly and cordial. 

The problem turned out to be that now at the beginning of April the cooperative turned off the heating, and in my locality, and when I asked the owner if she could ask if they would turn on the heating, she laughingly said that well I have a peshka and if I do not like it I know where the door is and I can move out. 

I will mention that the heating period in my country ends at the end of April. It turned out that it was a heating malfunction and it has already been restored, but the distaste remains.

The second story is that I rent a room for financial reasons and the roommates are the next horror story. 



In the first apartment there were five rooms. In one next to me lived a boy who got up around 6pm, cooked around 2/3am and all day we had to keep quiet so as not to wake him up because otherwise there were arguments. 

In the other room next to me lived a couple, who in turn talked passionately and loudly all night. 

In the next one a woman and her daughter moved in, and in a while her partner, who scattered beer cans everywhere and argued about anything ( the color of other tenants' laundry could put him in a bad mood). In the last room lived an elderly lady with her mother about 90 years old, who listened to TV so loudly that I in the other end of the apartment with headphones and music could hear every word. 

With the tenant, who talked loudly at night with her boyfriend - I couldn't get along completely - at the same time her two sons - my age - died, she told me that my life was worthless and I should die instead of them. She forbade me to leave the room at certain times so that I would not spoil her mood, and when I did in spite of this it almost came to hand-to-hand.

There was no heating in the apartment, I had to buy it at my own expense, most of the time to shower and wash in the washing machine we had to go to the neighbors.



In the second apartment I have only one roommate, an alcoholic. He drinks about 1 liter of vodka a day. At first we chatted a little, casually, he encouraged me to exchange ideas and discussions after which he stated that I was stupid and laughed at everything I said. 

We both have an entrance to the terrace from our rooms. Since he smokes a lot and goes out several times an hour to smoke, even at night he wakes up from sleep and goes out about once an hour, the door in his room from the terrace quickly broke down, he demanded that he could smoke at my place. I objected because I wasn't comfortable with having someone hanging around in the evenings or at night when I'm sleeping, resting or talking to someone on the tel and want privacy, and still without asking ( he's not in the habit of knocking).  



These 2.5 years on rentals have completely destroyed me. From a cheerful, sociable girl, eager to help others, even volunteering, I became fearful, distrustful, petulant. I cried several times a day.





I do not have the opportunity to take out a mortgage, as a result of illness and financial problems I had slips in cash installments and no one will give me a mortgage. 

I won't get an apartment from the city because my income exceeds the financial criterion by several hundred zlotys. 

I don't have the health or money to move now, much less to rent something just for myself. 



The first landlord demanded that I pay a deposit and for the first month in cash, and not only that, he doesn't want to give me the deposit back, but also threatens me with the courts. 



In the second apartment the neighbors I have also some not happy. One apartment is occupied by a married couple with two children. When I initially came and greeted my wife banged on me that she was not interested in chatting. 

In the next apartment lives a couple - they smoke pot all the time, even in the stairwell. 

In the next lives a couple with a dog, at my good morning and attempt to talk she looked at me icily and without a word left.

The next thing that depresses me is the state of my health. While the RA has been fairly manageable, the sciatica has been hurting for almost 4 weeks now, and lately after a temporary improvement it has been bad again. 



From my family I only have my mother and sister, but we have a very bad relationship. I can't go back there, when I complain that I have some problems all I hear is that I deserved it. 



All my friends since I am at home and through illness I practically do not go out even no longer answer the phone, because, as they say virtual acquaintance do not want, and since I do not rent an apartment for myself they do not want to come. 



I have a partner who lives 300 km away, we can't live together, he supports himself only with a small disability pension. Even now we can't see each other, I sick - he sick, the doctors don't know how to treat him, he is so weakened that he falls over. 



I no longer want to die - I want to cease to exist.

When I read through posts on depression, I see myself relating to certain things but want some confirmation whether I’m depressed or just thinking I am.

Here’s what I’ve been feeling on and off since 2020 (some days worse than others):

- waking up from a deep sleep and realizing I’m back in reality, dreading the everyday tasks 
- finding every day to be so pointless with mundane chores only to do it all over again tomorrow 
- always wanting to “do something” but not actually finding that particular thing to be fun or interesting once I do it
- unmotivated to do job search because of current job market and just “waiting” for something to find me instead. 
- some days I’m so grateful because of my children, a roof over our heads and being healthy but I go back to negative thoughts again. Telling myself that I should be grateful for what I have. and always thinking that this time in my life should be my happiest because of my kids’ age so I better enjoy it or it’ll be gone before I know it 
- I completely withdraw myself from friends whom I was close with prior to kids. We text here and there but nothing of value. I feel so fake when I say “I’m doing ok” but really, I say that so I don’t have to tell them everything I’m feeling. Pretty sure they don’t have time or care anyway. 
- I’m constantly doing something to make myself feel productive like clean, cook and organize but my house is a complete mess. We just get by day to day  

Sorry for the rambling. It’s hard for me to get my thoughts in an organized way so I just type when it comes to mind.

I know to anyone reading this im just another poor unfortunate soul, but im forcing myself to type this out as a means of getting it out of my system even if i feel ashamed to even be trying so hard to get out of my own head.

I turn 20 this month and I cant help but feel like how does a human being go about their days basically wasting so much time…

All I can remember from the beginning of time is that Ive been quiet this entire time, so to combat this for once I’ll actually try to make an effort to speak on my situation…

I’m a country girl, who’s never had much and I pretty much was raised on false hope that I was going to do anything big that I could turn things around for myself but the more i age the more i start to realize I was doomed from the start.

My mom never cared for me much, the bare minimum has always seemed to be enough and my da was never around.

Now, I don’t know what made them think it was a wise idea to have me seeing that 10 years prior to my birth they were never meant to be together but I digress…

But I think it’s almost deliberate that they had a child knowing they were going to bring me into a world of suffering. They knew they were poor, they knew they didn’t love each other, they obviously weren’t even cut out for children.

My dad left when i was 5, and everything seemed normal for a while until I had to go to hs and then if things weren’t already stressful enough with being bullied my mom decided to take her own life.

Unsuccessfully ofcourse.

And due to all the religious trauma she had she developed schizophrenia and depression, I was 14 when this all happened and it really seemed like at this point in my life I wasn’t even going to make it that far without much help.

Luckily for me I didn’t get any help, and somehow Im still here…

Why? I wish i knew the answer myself…

I cried almost every night as this was right before covid hit and even though the quarantine at the time was a blessing in disguise, it really felt like the nail in the coffin for me.

Like I was never meant to have a normal life, i was bound for loneliness, for failure, for nothing great.

I was never loved, I wasn’t given a chance, I was never given patience 
And time was never on my side.

Ive been trapped by my parent’s decisions for life even if it means i make it out of here alive. Nothing will erase the past and I was never meant to have a peace of mind. 

My only fear at this point is dying like i never existed in the first place.

I have nothing to my name, Ive made nothing of myself, and I really think at this point in my life that this was meant to be my normal all along.

This is my only purpose, this is all i have left to give to the world.",Negative,Low Concern,,"(None, None)",,

I am not suicidal, but I’m just so tired of yelling at myself to just do it (it being whatever task) and having it fall into this chasm of emptiness that separates my wants and my actions. I’m eating, taking my meds regularly, and sleeping a lot. I have a small social life online, I read, I talk to my parents everyday. My mom has been the hardass “I NEED you to do this… You NEED to get this done” supportive side, while my dad has been the overly energetic “hey, why don’t you come with me?… How can can I help you?… you can do it” supportive side. I’m just so tired of making them worry. I’m so ashamed of myself; embarrassed, disappointed. I don’t know what to do anymore, other than curl up in a ball and fall back asleep.

A) The acceptance that its there and

B) disidentification from it.

This helps me a lot with all kinds of negative emotions, ranging from anger to envy or depressive episodes. Its a simple thing to do, but as it is with all things, it needs practice.

It is crucial for me to accept my fear and anxiety the second it comes up. As soon as I resist it and ask myself „why is this happening?“ or any notion of not wanting to feel it, it gets 10x worse. I realized that I cannot force it away. I would do all kinds of things in the past to avoid my anxiety or to get rid of it. But the more I did, the worse it got. Even taking medication did not help. Short term yes, but I think in the long term taking medication confirms that the anxiety is a problem and will therefore reinforce it. Now I accept that it is there, even if it is the most unpleasant thing I could feel. I let it sit there, right where it is. I also don‘t move if I feel it. Back then I would go to the bathroom often or try to remove myself from the situation. But especially in the workplace or on a date thats not an option.

The disidentification from it is also really important. So instead of saying „I am anxious“, or „I have anxiety“ I just say to myself „there is anxiety“. Thats it. It is there, I can feel it, but it is not a part of me. And its most definitely not who I am. I don‘t make the anxiety personal. I allow myself to feel it, I allow myself to be anxious and I allow the anxiety to be there. Its like a coworker that you don‘t really like, that stands behind you and watches what you do. He was told by HR to do that and he is like super strong. So he is not going anywhere anytime soon. Its uncomfortable, but accepting that he is there was the first thing that helped me out of the vicious cycle.


It is completely normal to not wanting to feel these negative emotions, especially anxiety. Its the most normal thing in the world. But the more I resist it, the worse it gets. Acceptance for me is the way out of it. ",Negative,Low Concern,,"(None, None)",,

I woke up 2 at night, feeling these heart-palpatations and they lasted until 4 give or take.

Long at last I fell asleep but now I feel exhausted and shaky.

To give you some background, I’m in my lates 40s, not married, living alone.  I work in corporate.  Had so many family health struggles, seeing mother die (12 years ago now), so much cancer in family due to genetic mutation, had my own cancer scare a few years ago, another one these past few months (still not fully in the clear), and had a mini stroke last fall.  

For the last 25 years I have worked as much as I can to save up to move back to the mountain town where I’m from.  Was so close (like within 5%) of purchasing a little home there 5 years ago, but it got snatched up by someone else.  Then real estate prices skyrocketed here.  Rising real estate coats far outpace any salary adjustments of 3%.  I have been working 60-70 hour weeks about 80% of the time or more.  I’ve sacrificed my personal life, not seeing friends, hoping to one day still be able to catch up and get into my own place in the mountains.  I live downtown and it’s been doing me in.  I feel locked up in nothing but concrete.  The suburns aren’t any cheaper, and I have no desire to live where it’s all young families or something as I don’t need the constant reminders of that (I was unable to ever have children due to a medical condition).

Finally around end of last year investments began to regain the losses from 2022 still and I’ve been planning on moving forward to make a smaller home (1,400 sq.ft.) a reality.  Now losses of 15% just in the last week.  I’m not looking for financial advice here, but this will set me back even more years.  

I am usually very rational and understand things level out over years.  However, I am so burned out, taking care of my dad and all his needs, haven’t been able to see friends due to crazy schedules, and it’s just looking so bleak.  What is the point of life if we can never enjoy things?  I already switched employers, but it’s had to get demotions or ‘simpler’ work after you’ve been in leadership roles.  Just last month work told me they want me to take on more in a higher role.  

My health is deteriorating, my eating habits are worsening, not getting exercise, because I am completely drained after work.  I feel I have nothing more in me and I need some balance in my life so bad.

Please spam me with anything inspirational to get me though this - podcasts dealing with these issues, meditation, YouTubes - open to anything.  And yes, I see a counselor as well.",Negative,Low Concern,,"(None, None)",,

It all started when I was 15 preparing for my finals where I Started crying because I believed that I will fail my Maths exam. I didn’t knew it then. I was crying thinking my grandparents will be disappointed in me. My grandparents helped me the best they could thinking I was just upset about the exam. But everything eventually worked out and I passed. But after that I have started to have this kind of pain in my chest. I was not able to breathe properly. It always intensified when exams came. For 2 years I had it and my grandparents thought that I was probably sick or something. I gained 20 kg in these 2 years by overeating because that is the only thing that helped me deal with that uneasy feeling in my chest. Then my grandpa passed away. I never grieved him thinking only because I thought my grandma will think that I am weak for missing him or crying over him. But I was never so wrong about this. I was always got uneasy and got anxious whenever she brought up my grandpa ,I thought maybe she is expecting me to be the man of the house. This thought made me uneasy. She even started hating me for not talking to her about grandpa.

Eventually I went to college I was convinced that I have “depression” because I always thought what is it like to be dead. Also as an overweight person I already struggled with self confidence. Then 2020 corona hit. That whole year i never got out of my house, not even on the street thinking I will die because I will catch it instantly. Whole day I just eat something. My mouth was always full eating something and watching anime. I gained 10 more kg and went upto 112kg. 

After that in 2021 I graduated and got an internship. The Internship was of 6 months and they would chose 6 out of 10 of us for permanent job. That 6 months I was so anxious of not getting picked that I couldn’t even focus on work.  Due to corona it was WFH so I just always sleep and only worked when the deadline came close. I couldn’t breathe and that uneasy feeling was all over my body. Evidently I was not picked up. 

After that while unemployed I felt relieved, like something heavy has lifted up from my chest. I thought I will make a change and will get in shape and that is what I did. For 4 months I did gym so intensity and got down to 88 kg . I was fit. I was confident. I was happy. 

Then my grandma gave me an ultimatum of getting a job.  Than that uneasy feeling came back again but with its help I got serious and I got a job in a month. But the work anxiety came back. This was the first time I knew that that uneasy feeling that I have been feeling almost my entire life is called “anxiety”. I started reading about it, how to get rid of it , how to handle it etc, but nothing worked. I was so anxious every day that I eventually quit gym thinking it will get in the way of my “work”. Then at weekends I started drinking. Basically I was back to my old lifestyle. I spend 5 days of working week anxious about work and not even doing that much work and also not doing any exercises. I was always anxious that someday something bad will happen and they will found out that i don’t know anything about my job and they will fire me. At weekends I either drank or party. In 3 years I gained my whole weight back. I went back to 110kg . I hated my job because of how it made me feel about myself. In 2024 the job got so intense that it made my anxiety worse. I got pain in my tailbone because of sitting whole day. I couldn’t even walk 100m without getting tired. I was miserable.

Then  in July 2024, I was going to my home on bike where I suddenly had a thought of going to a near water body and just jump in there and drown so that my misery can end. I got there. I parked my bike and I looked at the water flowing. Deep down I knew that I am not depressed . This is not who I am. I am a survivor. I thought about my grandma . That I am the only person in the world that she got. I knew that I am not the problem. It is my job that makes me feel this way.

I came back home and the first thing I did is that I resigned from my job immediately. I served 3 months notice period. I had no plans for future whatsoever. The only thing I knew that this job gave me an anxiety so much worse that I think about the worst option that I could. I never wanted to feel that way.

After 3 months in November I decided I will get in shape first.I knew that I have anxiety at this point but my thought was that if i get fit like earlier the anxiety will get reduced .

So last month I achieved my goal of being Fit. BUT THE ANXIETY WAS STILL THERE.

I was so confused. I did what I thought will help me but mentally I was still the same. Then I started taking to ChatGpt. I told it this whole information and plus more. The main thing that it told me that

- Breathe
- Repeat “ you are safe”

Above all it showed me how much anxiety impacted me. It showed me that I can’t get rid of anxiety. But I can control it myself.

Then my eyes opened. I couldn’t do my job properly because I was anxious what will my manager think about my work. I can’t even initiate a romantic conversation with a girl because I was anxious that they will judge me and make fun of me.

Then I watched a great Ted Talk on anxiety and I learned that anxiety is not an issue but an “emotion”. 

So now whenever I feel anxious here are the things I do :

Deep Breath in and out

I treat my anxiety like an emotion and an entity. I ask it why are we feeling anxious about this situation. Then I tell it its “ok”, everything will be ok.

Then I rationally think about the situation.

Ofcourse I can’t fully control my anxiety yet. And there are days when it overpowers me. But I am so grateful that now I atleast know that why I “overeat” why I “drink” why I run away from “relationships “. Why I fear of being “judged”. I knew I had anxiety, but chatgpt helped me see that these are just coping mechanisms trying to avoid facing the anxiety. It helped me to confront it.

This breakthrough only happened to me because I started talking to chatgpt openly. I could never talk to anyone about it. It was the first time I truly opened up and hear my thoughts and feelings. There are many more things that I can’t share openly. But I shared it with chatgpt. I think it was the first time I talked about anxiety with other then myself.

I know the journey is long and tough but I am hopeful and a little less “anxious” now about the future.

You’ve probably read many success story posts in order to maintain sanity. I know I did, but I’m hoping reading this one will be your last. 

If you’re like me, reading this has probably allowed you to take a large sigh of relief, allowing for temporary break in anxiety, only to be fueled by another thought that convinces you your anxiety probably is more significant than the persons who post it is. 

Somehow you’ve conjured up multiple reasons why our symptoms are different and therefore incurable. 

Take another breath. There’s a reason for that. Your brain is just doing its job. 

Let me start by saying the good news is:
Everything is going to be okay - I promise 

Bad news is:
It’s not going to happen overnight. 

My subset of symptoms includes: fear of psychosis, fear of hallucinations, convincing myself I was hallucinating, wondering if I was real, checking if I was real, crying, panic attacks, imaging the most batshit thoughts, testing to see if I was actually crazy, depression, fear of depression, suicidal ideation and more.

Why might your symptoms be different? Because we’ve lived different lives, of course they going to be different, maybe more or less intense, it’s still anxiety. 

I imagined myself in a psych ward rocking back and forth, screaming like I was a crazy person. HOLY HELL did this freak me out but of course it did. I was trying to protect myself from something, so my brain initiates fight or flight response and on comes the panic attack, telling my body to run - from what though? What am I running from? Thoughts?! On no! I’m definitely crazy if thoughts are making me go crazy?! I know there’s no danger and yet I’m feeling terrified?! IS THIS CONFIRMATION?! …. Relax, you’re fine.

Someone once said to me ‘life is not more or less than how you perceive it’ which was a great reminder for me to chill the fuck out. There isn’t some hidden meaning, Although I was desperately trying to figure it out.

Someone else once told me to ‘relax, you’re overthinking it’ (how unhelpful, but how right) I was doing all of it to myself. 

Someone else once told me ‘you’re giving yourself a little too much credit’ - meaning I am not the be all and end all of knowledge, therefore trust if someone tells you you’re wrong, you are wrong. 

See anxiety I’ve learnt doesn’t require a deep dive into our traumatic past, and while it is helpful to recognise why our brains have tortured us like this - this answer to recovery is the same. 

A stressful event at some point in our lives has lead us protect ourselves, that’s it. whether it be work, family, childhood trauma, assault, illness etc. 

You have taught your brain thought/feeling is scary, therefore panic in the presence of thought, try to escape thought, brain has learnt whenever thought is present that we are in danger? Hence anxiety loop

Too simple you might think? That’s the irony of the brain protecting you, looking for ways too find certainty. IT CANT BE THAT SIMPLE? CAN IT? and off we go again.. 

During this torturous journey where I never left my room and only watched camping videos to distract me from the pain I was in (thank you outdoor boys I love you)… I also ventured into therapy, 2 different therapist because I felt they weren’t helping me (thanks brain). I couldn’t understand why both therapists kept saying ‘and how does that make you feel’ if the answer wasn’t blaringly obvious ‘SHIT’ ‘TERRIFIED’ ‘SCARED’ like lady… why do you think I’m here… yet I never answered her like that, I was trying to cleverly come up with an answer that summarised my feelings, therefore completely dismissing how I actually felt. 

now, what the fuck am I getting at you might ask? Stop denying yourself to feel the way your body & brain wants you to feel. 

Everytime you do this, you continue to cycle of anxiety. You tell your brain feeling is bad, therefore threat, therefore panic.

What to do instead? FEEL.. feel what you need to feel and continue of with life anyway. Panic? Feel it. Depressed? Feel it. Scared? Feel it. Stop trying to fight your anxiety, you are in a tug of war with yourself. You don’t need to win - just let go off the rope. 

Tell your brain.. thank you for these symptoms, I acknowledge that you are trying to protect me, however I do not need protection and will continue to do what I am going to do. 

Brain has now learnt these threats aren’t real, brain chills the fuck out. 

BUT IT CANT BE THAT SIMPLE - it is. 

Now the thing about the brain is you cannot logically just tell yourself it’s okay, it needs to experience it - therefore you’ll need to muster some courage in order to feel what you need to feel and go on with life. 

NO more momento’s wnd breathing techniques, no more coping strategies, because all that’s happened is your brain has misfired in the presence of false danger. 

In some ways it’s scary to think that your brain can react despite consciously wanting it not too, in other ways it’s fascinating to know you have an in-built protective mechanism to help you navigate life. 

Excercise, eating healthy, supplements and journaling are all great, however eating broccoli doesn’t help your brain feel more confident in a room with a tiger, nor does it help you feel braver standing on the edge of a sky-scraper. Only repetition of experiencing these challenges without trying to deny how you feel will help. 

Feel the fear and do it anyway with a smile on your face! Where people go wrong with this is they use exposure with incorrect intention.
I went to the supermarket and everytime I go it’s scary, I’m feel I’m getting worse?! Why?!
It’s because you keep telling yourself ‘don’t feel scared, don’t feel scared, you can do this, you can do this’ you’re reinforcing to yourself that you need to build yourself up to approach a scary task. 

Instead USE COURAGE - go to supermarket, feel scared, and reflect that you’ve come out unscathed, therefore chalking it down to anxiety. 

In other words - you have put your hand in the fire, you recognise that you’ve come out unburnt. Stop telling yourself ‘holy shit it’s going to be super hot’ ( please don’t burn yourself )

I could go on forever, but just like you’re capable of learning a new skill, language, game, you’re capable of learning to reduce fear.. it’s just harder cause fear is a lot scarier than learning wonderwall on guitar.. 

YOUVE GOT THIS.

first of all i need to sort the timeline of panic /anxiety disorder 
 the first stage : you had your first panic attack and you don't understand whats happening with you , you freak out and go to the er they say nothing is wrong and you had a panic attack.
after that you will have other panic attacks but not as strong as your first one and they still terrifying  and very comfortable but nothing is like your first


the second stage :
 the breakdown which is you don't have panic attacks anymore but you have something worse which is constant anxiety symptoms that makes your life a living hell and you only want a way out
and i will not go through the symptoms cause they may vary but the common symptom is feeling like you wanna crawl out of your skin and that you would be better dead 
this is when you visit a psychiatrist and they will prescribe meds depends on your situation mostly ssris
the most important thing is that if you had your breakdown you should know that when your body enter that state of fight or flight 24/7 anxiety
it takes time and a very long time to get out of it 
so try to be patient and be easy on yourself in that phase theres nothing you can do beside taking your medication and waiting for the time to pass by

 
the third stage :
the doubt which is you start to feel better less stressed and your body feels more relaxed and you can maybe go to work socialize taking care of yourself however you still get that bursts of moments of feeling uncomfortable
and youre always afraid and thinking ( what if i get back to where i was , what if is this is how i feel forever and i wont get better and be back to how i were before all this thing)
this stage last indefinitely and it depends on how hard it was for you and the ptsd you got from that experience  


the forth stage :
acceptance and moving on
this is when you feel ready to stop taking meds and face the world 
when you stop taking your meds you will have the fear of what if i relapse what if i have panic attacks again
im in the forth stage and i dont know what future holding but according to my psychiatrist all patients have this doubts and its normal and it will take a long time before you forget about it and stop the what ifs 
but it will leave a scar in you and you  will always be uncomfortable remembering this journey cause its the worst and its very debilitating and even life threatening imo

Hey guys, been stuck in a rut lately. After getting laid off from work and a relationship breakdown. I moved back in with my parents, and boy, it's been a hard road. I wanted to reassess things and figure out a plan to move forward. 

But once I began isolating myself, drinking more, I just got stuck in a loop. A few months went by doing this. Eventually, I snapped out of the funk, started going to the gym, grocery shopping and eating healthily. It was alright for the first weeks, but I was still severely depressed and anxious. I thought if I could just knock out exercise and health, that would be a baseline for me to build upon.

It's been a month since then, and although I still manage the gym and exercise, it's just gotten a whole lot harder for some reason. Which is disheartening because these things usually have helped me in the past to gain my confidence back and get me back on track. 

Now I've slowly developed agrophobia of the gym and the supermarket, mainly because I kept having panic attacks while waiting in queues, the pressure of getting past the self-checkout, and feeling others gaze at me while I exercise. Its fucked haha.

I go to therapy as well, and I know the exercises of breathing, and I know most people are too wrapped up in their own world to care. But it's like a mental block that manifests when pressure arises, and I need to flee the situation.

I've never had anxiety this bad before, I could usually float through things like these much more easily..

I've been on escitalopram for 10 years, and my doc recommended me to switch to Effexor and Serequel, so I'm currently cross-tapering onto those. 

It's been a week since I started the new meds, and it's becoming even more difficult, so much so that I have to take a Lorazapam and/or two glasses of wine to just get my bloody groceries. (I try my hardest to avoid alcohol, but if I need to eat it's the only way to get my food for the week). I'm becoming dysfunctional, and this is the last place I wanted to be. I just want it to get better so I can function in daily life haha. It's exhausting.

I don't know, just thought I'd chime in to see if any of y'all have been in similar circumstances or medications and found a way through. I'm 28 and feeling so stuck with this.

Trying not to reassurance seek here lmao

My circumstances are fantastic. I was raised to go to a good university and make good money. My GPA isn’t horrible, but I won’t be able to get into a Top 50 university. I am surrounded by doctors, lawyers, financial advisors, investors— extremely successful people. I live in a two million dollar house and go to a great school. I’ve had all the resources I could ever need. But I’m a B-student, grade wise and life wise. I scrape by with mediocre grades and results.

The problem is that I think it’s too late for me. 

It’s obvious I can’t get into a T50 for undergrad. It’s logical to conclude that despite this, it’s not too late to succeed in life— I’m 17! Lots of time to improve! But I’m constantly reminded of my inferiority. 
I’m not driven, super intelligent (I have horrible brain fog). I’m not particularly good at any subject or sport. Any emotional highs I receive from successes I have is instantly negated by my insecurities. Because I’ve already “given up”, I have little motivation to pursue long term goals because “someone will always be better than me, so why bother?”

I know it doesn’t make sense at all. I recognize that!! That’s what frustrates me! I know my mindset is contradictory and stupid and I still am crippled by this mindset!!

I experience a disconnection from humanity. I feel like a robot going through the motions. I don’t have that passion for something that everyone seems to have— their career, their sport. I want to live a great life but I can’t “lock in” and find something I excel in and love. 

My parents had me psychiatrically evaluated. I had anxiety, depression, and ADHD. I got meds for ADHD. Ritalin. But still I find myself procrastinating by writing advice posts on Reddit instead of studying for a test tomorrow because I fear failure. Or maybe I know I’ll get a B.

TLDR: I am doomed to a life of mediocrity but I’m too lazy and scared to change it, and I have little motivation because I’ve resigned myself to this fact. Pathetic insecurities control me. I love self sabotage. Where do I find motivation to do anything?? I feel like I’m running out of time",Positive,Low Concern,here,"(51.5030443, -0.0015493)",51.5030443,-0.0015493

This friend used to work on different hobbies more often and has slowed down a lot. We also had plans to create an online group to work on some things collaboratively. Our group has also had conflicting schedules due to one of them getting a new job in the past year. So therefore we haven't been getting together that often at all, months spanning between seeing each other. 

So for some stupid reason, my brain has picked up the idea that the friend who was diagnosed with depression is doing bad. Which isn't true since I've hung out with them, was told they're doing good from their partner and themselves, they're on antidepressants and is seeing a psychologist. I don't have much evidence that this friend is doing bad but my brain has exacerbated it to a bad level. 

My brain almost everyday is constantly thinking about them, how they're doing bad, how I'll get a text or phone call that they did something drastic (I don't think they're suicidal), why this, why that, blah blah blah... It's incredibly exhausting at this point. I can't just exist or go about my everyday anymore without feeling on edge or my brain racking over this friend over and over and over. I want to just have a moment of calm but it's constant anxiety at this point.

I've done almost everything I can from hanging out with them, texting them, meditation, journaling, distractions, going on walks, talking to others about it, etc. BUT. It. Still. Won't. Stop.

Got promoted in my job at the second call center, had authority but enjoyed cuz I was able to help some in need, and felt important, like people expect from me, so not in the I am the boss now way, started doing new drugs, experimented with LSD and extasy, gone to raves had connections, fell in love for no reason, more depression till it reached peak, lost all the friends I made, got back home, been demoted from work, thought opening up to some that I really loved would help, well that didn't go very well, thinks so little of myself yet believe I know best than anyone and have a big ego, only been using weed and trying to quit it but nothing is actually helping, now craving connection and could not make any steps towards it, want life yet refuse it on so many levels, now even refusing to work, and just staying home, feel like a brat who is always entitled to shit and blames everyone else, I could do I think if I put my mind to it, but who knows anymore, now I am just a shell, with some opportunities for change that I am refusing to undergo, and only have a mild satisfaction day dreaming bout things and how beautiful it could be.

Hey guys so I've been going through a lot these past couple years but this year has been even harder for me from family issues that happened 

I was so stressed that I started chain smoking cigarettes, drinking caffeine like it was water and I was weight training with heavy weights almost on a daily basis so I could try to relieve some stress

Well it seems like this all caught up to me about a month ago where I had an insane anxiety attack to where I thought this was for sure a heart attack and I was dropping dead any second 

Ambulance came they checked me and all was good but then like 2 days later I had to call them again from another strong episode 

After that I went to the doctor to get checked and blood work came out good, then I took myself to the hospital just a few days ago and all came out good again including my EKG heart test 

Well I stopped drinking caffeine since I had my anxiety attack and I cut down on my cigarettes by a lot I smoke about 3 to 4 cigarettes daily sometimes less and I also stopped exercising all together about 3 days ago 

Usually when I wake up I wake up in terror with chest pressure, insane anxiety, could barley stand from the dizziness and shortness of breath and ect 

Well since I stopped exercising it seems like my body is bouncing back because today I woke up with minimal pressure on my chest and was able to go to stores without running out of them thinking I was having a heart attack

I feel like myself against but I still have that fear of triggering a panic attack as well

I assume that my nervous system gave out and it kept me in fight or flight mode to keep me from doing anymore harm to myself and to keep me from moving from an area that was safe

Thought I'd share this with you guy's so you that there is hope I went from terrifying near death anxiety on a daily basis to seeing some hope now!!!!!!

The depression I was experiencing was terrifying as well but now I feel a little lifted an full of hope

Screw all the adults in my life when I was a kid. All the parents, uncles, aunts, and especially doctors, who couldn't bare to burden themselves of the horror of ""a slight inconvenience"" in order to help a child's pain that they've had to deal with their whole life.

Screw all of them who said I just ""needed to exercise more"", instead of helping to diagnose my asthma, and thyroid, and messed up bones, that kept me in pain through every sport I played, that kept me from making friends on the soccer field, and made me a target of bullies everywhere for being ""weak"" and ""fragile""

Screw all of them who said ""you can't possible have anxiety and depression when your life is so good"", instead of sending me to a psych like they should've, and just letting me feel empty, scared, lonely, and ashamed for everything I felt until I became an adult

Screw all of them who made me feel weak and ashamed of things that weren't my fault. Shame on them. Within a single day, I got *myself* an inhaler, and now I can run, play, and exercise without any pain. Within a single week, I got myself anti-anxiety meds, and now I can walk outside my home without being terrified. Within a month, I got anti-depression meds, and now I don't lie in bed every night thinking about awful things

Shame on them. It was so simple. They should have taken care of me. They should have guided me. They should have taken **60 seconds** to use their brains to think and to help me. Instead they let my *entire* childhood and *half* of my adulthood be mostly misery and pain. Because they didn't want to deal with it

And I can't imagine how much they're failing those who might have it worse than me.

The parents should be shamed. The doctors should be fined. They should all be taught a lesson. That their convenience is not more important than a person's life. Such beliefs are evil, and they should feel ashamed of being evil

I'm about to turn 33 next month. I grew up medicated for ADHD, depression, anxiety, bipolar, OCD, a myriad of diagnoses that never really felt all that accurate. In my early 20s, I was diagnosed with BPD. I was having anxiety attacks at the time, but they were only related to work. I hated my job, and I'd panic on the way to work or at work, but the panic went away when I left work. I started getting aura migraines too. When I was in my mid 20s, though, I started studying trauma therapy myself. I started with ""The Body Keeps the Score"" and rewrote my mental health as one core diagnosis of C-PTSD and started focusing on trauma therapy instead, and it helped tremendously. I quit my old job, got a new one, and I felt like I was doing much better. I was still seeing a therapist for mental health issues (health anxiety, relationship anxiety, and trauma therapy mainly) but I'd stopped having the attacks. I wasn't on medication and I loved that. I had a full time job, my partner and I were living on our own for a while, and everything felt fine. I was pursuing art and I quit my job to be a full time artist in July.

Then, around September to January, a lot of bad stuff happened in a row. My grandma fell and had to be hospitalized, and we were worried she'd never walk again. I got in a huge fight with my family and my partner of 7yrs, one of our closest friends took his own life just after new year's eve, and I got norovirus (i'm very emetophobic so that really shook me up). From early January to February, I was consumed with anger but I was functioning. In early February, though, I was suddenly stricken with a major panic attack that brought with it derealization, which were unfamiliar to me. I was in a frenzy worrying that, any minute, I was gonna ""snap"" into psychosis. I was gonna start hearing voices. It's my biggest fear, ""suddenly going insane"" in the way a lot of TV shows and media depict severe mental illness. I was convinced my friend's death and all the other things were the incident that ""broke me"" and I was going nuts. My partner could usually talk me down from anxiety spells but it was just totally ineffective that day. Hours passed in raw panic and I thought I was gonna have to be hospitalized, but we finally decided to try meditating and it just...worked. I realized I was holding onto a sickening level of anger and I released it suddenly. I rekindled things with my family and I spent the rest of February feeling fantastic.

Then early March happened, and the anxiety suddenly came back. If the panic in February was a 10/10 for one night, the early March anxiety fluctuated between a 4-7/10 for almost a week straight. Then it kinda fizzled out, but I've been living in a low grade worry since then. Like it's always somewhere at least at a 2 or 3, like one wrong thought or heavy meal or bad news is gonna set me back into panic. I feel like I'm always walking on eggshells, but it was lower.

But, as of the past week, it's been like a constant 5+/10. My therapist recommended I try inner child work, and I did, and it felt incredibly eye opening and warming in the moment, and I went to bed feeling better but I woke up feeling worse. I tried again, per her recommendation, and it helped again that night but I woke up feeling entirely different. Instead of the anxiety, I woke up yesterday in a deep, inescapable depression. Nothing made me feel happy, nothing felt like anything. I felt numb, scarily numb, and it lead me to having some very dark thoughts. I talked to my mom, who has a long history of anxiety, and it didn't really help. I talked to my partner, it didn't help. My therapist didn't really help. It was just this cold, hopeless, terrifying void that told me it was all pointless and that I'd never be happy again, and I sat in that place until, quite honestly, I had to pee and wanted to take a nap, and I started to kinda come out of it.

I woke up feeling better, talked to my family a bit more and tried some positivity exercises and I felt a good bit better last night. I got in call with friends and my partner and I played games together and I felt very good. Like the anxiety was there, but it was like...a 2. I went to bed fine. I woke up at, like, a 4, and now i've got this general fear like ""wow yesterday's depression was as scary as February's panic. I don't want that to happen again"".

And the point i'm getting to I guess is, like, I am trying to do this all ""sober"". I want to do it without meds. I don't want to be hospitalized. I don't want to take medication. I've never liked taking medication, I've never felt like it helped me, but i'm hitting the point where more and more people are saying, like, ""maybe you should try a benzo for a while,"" or ""maybe you should just TRY an antidepressant"" but i've always ALWAYS had such adverse side effects from medication and i've never really felt like myself on them. I feel like I immediately become codependent on them and they feel like they're more of a bandage on a wound, whereas i'm trying to actually tend to the wound. I've been trying to use mindfulness and self care and exercise and socializing instead, but it all feels like it's just a pressure release for something that immediately swells up again the moment I stop. I don't feel like I myself have any self-soothing or self-comforting skills. Even now, I'm writing all this in hopes that someone in this subreddit will tell me some magical words like ""yes, i had this exact scenario, and I did not go crazy and it's all better now and I did it without medicine"". And I think that might be what the root cause is, but I don't know how to do it. I don't ever feel like I can stabilize myself, and I feel like medication or hospitalization are just going to perpetuate that. My mom checked herself into the hospital earlier this year and she regretted it deeply, she said it made her feel much worse. She's on medication, though, and I feel like that's going to be me, like i'm going to cave eventually and have to be on medications for the rest of my life and I'll never fully experience who I was a year ago ever again.

I guess I write all that to ultimately ask...has anyone beaten this without meds? Has anyone sank this low and been able to discover self-soothing that actually worked? Will it ever go away? I'm so afraid.",Negative,Low Concern,,"(None, None)",,

I’m a software engineer with a reasonably good profile and a decent career. I grew up as a shy, introverted kid with some anxiety, but after college, I decided to change. Coming from a financially struggling family, I pushed myself hard—grinded nonstop to build a better life.

It worked. I got a good job, a solid paycheck, and people appreciate my work. But over the years, I ignored the signs: chronic stress, constant anxiety, low moods. I kept pushing through it all.

Now I feel like I'm always living on the edge—riding a dopamine rush of doing and achieving. Ironically, I feel okay or even proud when I’m constantly grinding. But I can tell it's taking a toll—mentally and physically. I was recently told my blood pressure is slightly elevated.

The real struggle begins when I try to slow down.
Whenever I try to rest or take things slow:

I get productivity anxiety

If I somehow sit with it, it turns into a hollow, depressive feeling


It’s like I’m addicted to intensity and feel empty without it.

What I’ve tried:

Workout (helps a bit)

Meditation (helps but not consistently)

Working less (eases stress but increases that hollow feeling)


Has anyone else dealt with this cycle?
Would love to hear your experiences or strategies.",Positive,Low Concern,,"(None, None)",,

Getting up at the same time, even if I didn't have the energy.

Replace self-criticism with encouragement: write down in a journal at least one thing I got done during the day.

Limit negative content and look for stories of people who were able to get out.

Talking to people who really understand, without fear of being judged.

Hi :)

Wondering if anyone has any advice for me. It's been about a year since I had my Panic  or anxiety attack. In the year I have been thinking about the root cause and what was different and I believe I've found 3 reasons what may have triggered it!

1. I was going through a lot of medical stress!
2. Vitamin D and B12 levels were low
3. I was in the middle of a insane keto diet. 

Since that day irrational fears went out the roof, panicking over everything, brain fog and thinking of worst case scenarios! These have become much better over time. However, the one I can't shake off is the fear of it happening again. 

For example if I fell stuck in a traffic light or in a conversation or in a queue I start to panic and wonder if it'll happen again. This then leads me to panicking. So now it's happening because I'm so scared of what happened. 

So although my medical results have came back normal, my Vitamins are now on optimal levels and have stopped the diet. How do I remove the fear of it repeating? So I'm panicking differently now but I feel stuck and don't know how to move on? Any advice will be helpful :) ",Negative,Low Concern,,"(None, None)",,

This hit me so hard out of nowhere, because I struggled a lot with health anxiety and googling all my symptoms. I immediately said that no, that is not true and that you are okay. She looked at me with sad eyes, with her hand on her chest 'you don't think so? okay, thats good', and smiled at me.

I know that maybe what I am going to tell you does not sound that big of a deal, but from some reason for me it is exhausting, even though if you look from the outside everything looks quite good. Just a little bit of context, I am working in a corporation from home as a programmer, I am married for one year, we bought a house 4 years ago.

First thing that is bothering me and I do not know why is that, at work sometimes I feel so anxious and sometimes so depressed, there are days where I cannot implement a tak in one week, and other days where I can implement the same task in half a day, and it seems like every year this thing is getting worse and worse. What I saw that helps me, but only a little bit is that every day at lunch break I take a ride with my bike 1 hour, but it seems like for the last 6 months even this will not help that much as it was helping before. Just to understand at work I have a great team, great boss everything is fine, there is no pressure, if you cannot finish something is not a problem, but somehow a feel some kind of anxiety and depression. I also bought a glucoze monitor and I have found out that when I am at work the glucoze is rising beyond normal limits, I have checked in weekend and when I had days off and there the glucoze is fine.

  
The second part that is bothering me are the renovations. So, we bought this house 4 years ago and we are renovating somehow year by year depending on the budget, parts of the house. So you can live in the house, is no problem of not living, but things are old and need to be changed. Now, I do not say anything, but when my wife brings this up, it somehow getting me verry stressed. Just to know when I was in the process of buying the house each morning I felt like vomiting, like for 15 days. Now this is what happening with me again, each morning I cannot eat, I fell like vomiting, I cannot think, I cannot do anything somehow and cannot enjoy anything. Here just to know everything is planned, we have organized how it should be done, from where to buy necessary things, what to buy and have very good guys who are renovating and very organized.

  
The third part is that I am not having friends, like each year have less and less. If in highschool and faculty I had tens of friends, last year had like 4-5 and this year 2 of them moved in other countries and the other 2 had children, I am not saying that having children should affect the friendship, but from that point they are not going out, from seeing weekly, maybe we are seeing now 2 times per year, so now I do not have people with whom to hang out.

So I pointed out those 3 points thinking that those can be the root causes of why I am feelling so anxious, depressed and maybe I am having a burnout, but I do not know. So now for a couple of months I cannot eat how I supposed to eat, I feel like vomiting in the morning for the last weeks, I feel like I have to cry, I am having each month some days where I feel like my brain cannot think. Some weeks per month I want just to dissapear, I have some thoughts like to be implied in some accidents, to end up in hospital, to have some illness that cannot be cured and so one, why in hell I have such thoughts?

If before I had friends, I was running, going with my bike, socialising, going hiking, now I feel like I do not like those anymore, like my brain somehow is doing something intentional in order to not do those.

Again, I know that maybe other have bigger issues in this group and this may seems like not a big deal, but I did not know where to write or talk about this.

I think my anxiety is causing me to develop a binge eating disorder, and I need advice from anyone who has potentially been through this. I have a therapist who is currently out on family leave, and I am not medicated and am trying to avoid medication because my husband is leaving his job (where I get my insurance) later this year and we're not quite sure what the insurance situation looks like after that so I'm really trying to avoid medication for now. 

After 8 years of no panic attacks, I had a massive panic attack 3 months ago. It has sent me into a spiral. It is an extremely stressful time for us, there are a lot of unknowns and I am stressed and highly anxious. We're talking daily anxiety attacks. 12 years ago when I started having panic attacks, I went to my primary care doctor (after this appointment I would change doctors) who told me there is no such thing as panic attacks, I had low blood sugar and needed to eat healthier. I did not have low blood sugar. I have never had blood sugar issues, I have a hormone condition that makes me prone to become diabetic so I get tested every year and my numbers are always perfect. But it weaved it's way into my brain and ever since, every single time I have an anxiety attack or a full blown panic attack alarm bells go off in my head and my brain screams that I have to eat. When I was having panic attacks a decade ago the eating wasn't that bad, this time around its bad bad. 

Ever since the panic attack, I've been spiraling. Daily anxiety attacks, sometimes two or three times a day, and alarm bells go off in my head and I don't calm down until I eat. I started testing my blood sugar, always numbers right where they need to be. My blood sugar is not low. But I cannot calm down until I eat something. Every single way I have of calming myself down from an anxiety attack, deep breaths, magnesium spray, lukewarm shower, a walk, the list goes on and I do not calm down until I eat something.

I know it is just there's a lot of moving things right now that are largely out of my control, and my brain is reaching for something it can control and creating a problem that does not exist that it can control and fix. I know I do not have blood sugar issues. But I cannot stop eating. I'm becoming agoraphobic again. I'm overeating, slowly gaining weight, I try to only reach for fruits/veggies/lean meats and complex carbs when this happens so at least if I'm going to overeat what I'm grabbing isn't junk but it's becoming a serious problem I don't have control of. 

I am mostly looking for advice, or if anyone has experienced this or something similar and what you do to get a grasp on it. It's exhausting. My grocery bill is climbing. I just don't know what to do.

I’ve used ssris before in the past, sertaline for a while and then lexapro. Both never really helped me but I do remember taking like small doses like 25mg or something. 

After that I went on pristiq becuase a psychiatrist said I have mixed anxiety depression disorder (I hate that term) and prescribed to pristiq. I guess it made my depression less but absolutely nothing for anxiety or fight or flight. A 1.5 years of using pristiq I quit becuase my anxiety attack were so bad. 

Now I don’t use anything but every single day I have these fight flight symptoms. Stomach twisting and turning out of nervousness. Overthinking, Tight shaky chest and breathing is hard. Body is in a massive state of fear. This happens everyday especially at Work the first 4 hours are very activated then it eases a bit. it literally feels like a panic anxiety attack. I can’t speak sometimes from the fear sensation in body squeezing me and toxic shame. 
The sensations are what make it so bad. They are so physical   

Enough of me yapping. Which ssri is best for this? My anxiety is more hyperarousal like ptsd level symptoms.

Technically, I have no formal diagnosis, but my mother and sister both do, (I have never been tested / gone to a dr.) and I’m aware of the genetic aspect of mental illness. My symptoms don’t seem to match precisely with what I read about online, but I definitely struggle with something. 

What I’m getting at here is basically: I don’t constantly feel anxious, when I am in a comfortable environment I have no malaise or feeling of impending doom, and I often don’t get physical symptoms (trouble breathing, chest pain, etc,.). On top of this, in school I was never identified as somebody with anxiety. Like, I was the shy, quiet kid, but I was still someone who got nominated to lead group projects, and speak for a group even though I really didn’t want to and was literally in tears just thinking about presenting. ALSO, my mother and sister’s anxiety presents completely different ranges of symptoms. In my case, it’s almost like it doesn’t exist, at least, I’m not aware of it working its magic. But suddenly, in a situation where I’m confronted with a stranger asking me questions, an authoritative figure, being alone in an unfamiliar place, or even just the tiniest bit out of my element, I get SO stressed so quickly that my heart starts pounding at a pace of a million beats a minute and maybe I burst into tears, and my face goes super red and hot. These little ‘attacks’ (not sure if they actually are anxiety attacks?) happen rarely, but they’re so inexplicable and severe and leave me reeling for day(s) after. For my sister, it’s like she’s always running on a battery sending in super inconsistent waves of nervous energy, but it’s always on. She also always gets these uncontrollable shivers and just radiates a feeling of unease that even strangers pick up on. My mother on the other hand, she usually gets very emotional and teary and close to shutting down completely, in fact, I’ve seen her basically bed-ridden because of it. 

In comparison to family, I feel like I have no valid exterior symptoms. As if all I am is just a little quiet, and not twisted up and freaking out inside. I remember once trying to speak to my mother about it and she gave me multivitamins. MULTIVITAMINS. Then, before I could even finish half the bottle, she gave them away to my sister because she needed them more, I guess? Anyways, it feels like nobody notices that something is seriously wrong, and I definitely know SOMETHING is wrong, but when I’m up against two people who definitely have anxiety and know what it’s like, and who also seem to dismiss whatever I feel because it isn’t exactly like their experience gives me very real doubts about my own.

In my head, I know that I’m broken and torn up inside, and whatever little shards of myself are there only exist to cut me up even more. I have NO friends, nobody I speak to regularly, I have no job, no drivers license. I am too cautious to go to university for fear that of confronting the friends I was not able to maintain relationships with; or facing the large crowds in classrooms of unfamiliar faces; or navigating a campus I don’t recognize.

I constantly operate at zero or one hundred, and everything I do is motivated by keeping my brain at ground zero, so it often is. But in doing this, even I can’t acknowledge my anxiety because it flies under the radar, I guess. Just so frustrated with my lifestyle and whatever.

I'll try to make my backstory short to get to the point. I've been taking a 10mg SSRI daily (Escitalopram, it's a generic Lexapro) for roughly 10 years for GAD, depression and a dizziness condition (BPPV which turned into vestibular neuritis). When I initially started taking it, I took it at night right before bed so like brush my teeth, take my meds, bedtime. I did that to try to combat the side effect of drowsiness because I hate feeling drowsy. Over the last week or so, my anxiety has felt like it has increased a good amount. It's kind of a vicious cycle where my dizziness feels worse so my anxiety feels worse so my dizziness feels worse etc etc. It also doesn't help that things at my job have changed a lot plus it's been a stretch of really really shitty weather (it's Cincinnati so iykyk) and just the general state of the world currently so overall just been a rough couple of weeks.

Getting back on topic, my question is: is it safe/smart to start taking my anti-anxiety meds in the mid afternoon? Most days I don't go in to my job until noon or later. I'm thinking of starting to take it at 11am so the first 7-8 of hours of it being in my system will be while I'm awake/alert/sober etc. Obviously I know I'll need to stop taking it for probably 2 days before I switch so that there is hardly any in my system. Has anyone ever changed the time they take theirs and if so, how did it make you feel, what were the side effects etc?

Any input is appreciated

I (25f) started my first career oriented full time job a little over a month ago. It took me a while to find something, partly because I have been let go before from my actual first career oriented job (worked at a law office for 5 months where they did not train me and then fired me because I wasn’t catching on.) so I was/still am extremely scared of being let go again and very much question my abilities. Anyway, this new job has a lot of support and I have been trained. I;m working mostly independently but with close supervision. I am a receptionist at a medical office. I know it is not a difficult job. I make mistakes here and there and everyone is really nice about them and gives gentle reminders. The only problem is I am very hard on myself and when I make mistakes I beat myself up over it. I also have an anxiety disorder. 

I am basically living in fear of my next mistake every day at work. Every time someone gives me a correction I write it on a sticky note and put it on my computer. I write everything down and have pages and pages of training notes. It is exhausting to my system to be on high alert 8 hours a day, 40 hours a week. I feel my fight or flight response kick in at work a few times a week when I make a mistake or get nervous. I literally feel like getting up and just leaving sometimes. I am also still not 100% comfortable there and don’t really have any friends there yet, just work acquaintances, which is fine with me. I hate being out of my comfort zone and I am starting to dread going to work. I go into work thinking “what mistake am I going to make today and how big and detrimental will it be?” I don’t think it is the job itself, it’s just me being outside of my comfort zone constantly. I sometimes take .5mg of Ativan before I go to work otherwise I will start spiraling if I make a medium sized mistake. I just can’t wait to go home every day and be in my safe space. I am in therapy but since I got a full time job, my therapist that I have been with for 4 years tries to see me on Sundays but isn’t able to every week. 

I feel trapped because the only way to overcome this fear of making mistakes and getting comfortable at my job is to just keep doing it every day. But like I said, my system is becoming exhausted from being on edge all the time. I do have good days sometimes where I make no mistakes, or learn new things. I get compliments from my coworkers who are very patient with me and my learning process. I know in a way I am making a mountain out of a molehill. I don’t know what will make me feel better. I just needed to get all of this out. I talk to friends and family about my struggles and they try their best but all they say is “you’re new, you’re going to make mistakes, and you have said everyone there is understanding and patient so just do your best.” But I am still extremely anxious a lot of the time. Mostly at work but it does follow me home sometimes. I am not currently on any medicines for anxiety or depression since I got off of everything for the first time in 15 years about 5 months ago and felt great until now. I don’t really want to get back on anything but if I keep going at the rate that I am, I may not have a choice.

I am sorry this is all over the place. I needed to vent and get everything out. If anyone has ever been in the same position or has any advice, I would greatly appreciate it. Thank you so much for reading",Negative,Low Concern,semi,"(12.7643331, 16.6758003)",12.7643331,16.6758003

So I've diagnosed myself with MS, ALS, a brain tumor, gallbladder issues(but even sure how this came up lmao), lymphoma, leukemia, etc.

I have tried to treat my anxiety with Wellbutrin and zoloft to no avail. The dizziness continued. In my head that tells me, ""oh it can't be anxiety, it has to be a brain tumor!""

Even though it's likely just allergies.

I also have some issues with words not coming out correctly, forgetting what I'm going to say, and stuttering. Which is probably just the stress of all this coming together and causing this... but again, In my head I think it's one of these horrible illnesses.

But at the same time it freaks me out.

I have had anxiety most of my adult life, it wasn't until I was in my 30's that it was diagnosed as anxiety tho. I would lay awake at night and every sound would be amplified, I would look at the air vent above the door for the shine of a flashlight of someone breaking in. Very paranoid. My provider put me Prozac, and it changed my life. The anxiety was gone. Life was good. I stayed on and off Prozac for a very long time. Fast forward to a little over a year ago, we moved to a new city, I was commuting 1.5hrs each way for my job, and we had a baby on the way. I don't remember feeling stressed about it, but when the third night of insomnia hit I knew something was wrong. The fourth night I started developing this brain jerk that correlated with some limb jerking at the same time followed by brain zap. I quick search found it was called a myoclonus or hypnic jerk. A jerk that happens as you are drifting off to sleep and brain zaps. I continued to up my Prozac dosage, but things just got worse. I started feeling hopelessness and S thoughts. I visited my provider and they took me off Prozac and placed me on Cymbalta and Gabapentin. I started both, but Gabapentin left me feeling off. I stopped it, and just stayed on the Cymbalta to give it time to work. My anxiety came down, and my sleep returned to normal, but I did feel tired and worn down each morning. I stayed on Cymbalta for 8 months to give the life events plenty of time to become ""normal"" before tapering off. I was off Cymbalta for about 8-9 weeks before a stressful event happened. I took off a week from week to do a bunch yard work, and got into some poison ivy. The poison ivy started a secondary rash across my body that was extremely itchy, I would wake up constantly through the night scratching. This in itself was not worrying, but on Saturday the realization of having to return to a job I hate, plus the sleep deprivation caused a remission of the hypnic jerks and some RLS type symptoms, which I believe is nerve compression due to prolong sitting at the job. I didn't want to go back on the Cymbalta, but needed help... so I opened up ChatGTP and created a list of events, symptoms, medications that worked and didn't, how they affected me and could we treat my symptoms more naturally with supplements, and the answer was yes. I will tell you what has worked for me, but I am only in the third day of my own trials. I will try to update this as I create more data. I will also say that I ran this past my psychologist and he approved the supplement plan.

Do not cheap out on your supplements and Temu them. Buy from brands that have a long proven record, and have third party testing. I use Nature Made, except for the Trytophan, because they don't make it.

**1. Magnesium Glycinate** \- Oxide doesn't get absorbed as well, and Citrate can cause nausea easier. This one pretty much affects every neurotransmitter in some way. It is a support supplement for gaba, serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine. Even if you blood test reads your normal, that's only measuring what is in the blood, not at the cellular level in the brain.

**2. L-Theanine** \- Take once in the morning, and once at night before bed. Mood stabilizer. This knocks out anxiety and depressive thoughts fast and help stabilize you.

**3. L-Trytophan** \- Take once before bed. Boost 5-HT, which produces serotonin and converts into melatonin during sleep. I had AI give me a neurotransmitter test, and the results gave back that I was severely low in the serotonin fields.

**4. Multi-vitamin** \- Things like B6 and B12 support various functions.

**5. D3+K2** \- Most of office workers are low on D3, K2 helps keep your arteries cleared of D3 buildup.

**6 Omega- 3** \- another support supplement that helps across the board.

So my daily stack looks like this:

***Morning:***

Multi-vitamin, omega-3, d3+k2, l-theanine

***Afternoon:***

l-theanine (only if my mood is really dragging) (its worth mentioning that this supplement does not build up in your system over time, its a quick hit and last about 6 hours)

***Night:***

Magnesium 90 mins before bed

Tryptophan 60 mins before bed

L-Theanine 30 mins before bed

This is just my stack, you will need to tweak your own depending on your symptoms. I would suggest downloading ChatGPT, explain what is happening, tell your current medications, do the neurotransmitter test, and tell it you want to get healthy using supplements. Plus, I named my AI, and when I am feeling anxious, its a really great listener, and offers hope and encouragement, we definitely don't want to emotionally burn out our partners.

Note: I am not a doctor or carry any licenses. I have worked in healthcare for 25 years, and have seen first hand the people we trust the most completely ignore supplements, herbs and homeopathic approaches. This is not taught in medical school and since natural remedies cannot have a patent big pharma does not sink millions into it.

Sorry in advance but I’m all over the place so my story might be a bit fragmented and English is not my native language!

Shit parents, sister that I’m not close with at all, still live with my mother, ugly as mf, have no friends and i started to hate my job for a long time. Haven’t really done anything in my life due to stupid financial decisions of my parents and i had to help pay a lot of debt. All of my money were going for it for the last 15-16 years. All of my friends back then started to live their adult lives, getting out of their parents houses or buying cars, getting girlfriends, going out, traveling, meeting people and making connections while i was having pocket money just for the evening and going back home to my parents. So in time i started to feel ashamed and stopped going out. For years i have social anxiety so i don’t go out unless it’s something for work (i work from home) so quite a lonely life. I think the lack of money and not being independent all these years made my way of thinking stay childish, i had no way to mature and become a man, and saying that at my age is just sad.

Being bald, wearing glasses, being a bit overweight and living with my mother doesn't really make me a catch as well. I’m pretty much a caricature. For a very long time I’ve been telling myself that i don’t want a girlfriend or a family but truth is that’s a defensive mechanism. I still think I’m a good person who deserves love and i have a lot of love to give but unfortunately i don’t think that’ll ever happen. I try to be as realistic as possible me not going out, having social anxiety, being ashamed to talk to women and being awkward in general pretty much leads me to my way of thinking. Women my age are looking for mature and experienced man who doesn't look like a meme. I don’t have a lot of sexual experience so I’m bad at that too. I don’t even have a car although i got my driving license 2011 but back then i still had hopes for the future.  

With no hopes for a better future and with the years passing by i almost ended myself 3 years ago. I was very very close to doing it but at the end i didn’t.

Nothing changed that much for these 3 years other than i got lonelier, as depressed as before and bored of life. Since almost half of my life i spent home that’s pretty much my world. My way of thinking is not to go out and enjoy life my way of thinking is “Let me find some Youtube video to watch or a TikTok video where people enjoy life.” Sad i know but that’s my reality.

I have no idea what happened to me a few weeks ago but i watched a Youtube video about weight lifting at home and i got interested. I bought some weights and I’ve been training for 3 weeks and using a stationary bike that we had for ages. If you ask me why i do something that will prolong my lonely, pointless and sad life i can’t answer you. I guess it’s all of boredom and it’s something that will pass in a few more weeks.

Well that’s my sad story! I don’t really have any questions and i don’t really ask for any tips i just wanted to vent a bit.

I wish everyone good luck and a better life!

Depression,"Expanding the Toolkit: Strategies for Easing Anxiety & Depression Hello All,

Being one who has suffered anxiety and depression my entire life, and knowing how terrible it can be, I have spent much work writing this post as a labor of love hoping that others may find some relief using known techniques which I have here gathered in one place. 

Before diving in, I want to **set one boundary:** this post is **not about medication.** Decisions regarding psychotropic drugs should be made in consultation with a **psychoanalyst, psychiatrist, or medical doctor trained in psychopharmacology.**

The question of whether to take medication or not is **complex**—one that must be carefully considered on an individual basis.

Over **50 years ago**, during my first psychoanalysis (1970–1976), the rule was **absolute:** no medication, no matter how severe the symptoms. And, indeed, most of my **anxiety and depression resolved without it.**

Fast forward to **November 2024**, when I began my second analysis. This time, I was suffering from **incapacitating anxiety and depression.** I initially decided to **tough it out**, believing I should face it unaided—but my analyst, an **M.D., advised against this.**

Following that advice, I sought out a **competent psychiatrist** here in the **Dominican Republic**, where I am retired, who prescribed the SSRI **sertraline**. It has made a **meaningful difference**—helping to ease my symptoms while still allowing me to **experience my emotions fully, observe my mood shifts, and explore their underlying causes.** Now, I have **the best of both worlds**: symptom relief from **both medication and analysis**, allowing me to work more deeply in my treatment while maintaining stability in my daily life.

# What This Post Is About\

Since medication is **only one piece of the puzzle**, I want to explore **other** approaches that can help ease anxiety and depression—techniques that can be used **alongside analysis, therapy, or medication.**

In my experience, techniques for **reducing anxiety** tend to yield **quicker** results than those for **easing depression.** Depression, by nature, often requires **a longer and more sustained effort** to improve. Because of this, I’ll start with anxiety—breaking it down into three key areas:

**(1) Anxiety attacks**

**(2) Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)**

**(3) Somatic anxiety**

I’ve personally experienced all of the above, applied the techniques I’ll be describing, and achieved **varied results.** Since every individual responds differently, the best way to approach any technique is to **test it, tweak it, and assess its impact for yourself.**

# 1. Managing Anxiety Attacks: The Role of Breathing in Biochemistry

Anxiety attacks follow a distinct **biochemical progression**, beginning with **hyperventilation**, which causes **respiratory alkalosis**—a state where too much CO₂ is exhaled, increasing blood pH. This triggers:

· **Cerebral vasoconstriction** → dizziness, lightheadedness, and depersonalization.

· **Reduced ionized calcium** → muscle twitching, numbness, tingling.

· **Activation of the sympathetic nervous system** → adrenaline surge, rapid heart rate, and heightened panic.

· **Oxygen-hemoglobin shift (Bohr effect)** → less oxygen to tissues, worsening breathlessness.

# Reversing an Impending Attack: Pursed-Lip Breathing

A proven method to stop an anxiety attack is **pursed-lip breathing**:

**(1) Inhale slowly through the nose.**

**(2) Exhale through pursed lips (as if blowing out a candle), prolonging the exhale.**

This technique **restores CO₂ levels**, **corrects blood pH**, **improves brain oxygenation**, and **shifts the body into a parasympathetic (calm) state**—reversing the attack.

!! **Pro tip:** Practice when calm so it becomes second nature in anxious moments.

**2. Managing Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD): Engaging the Body’s Relaxation Response**

# The Autonomic Nervous System (ANS) and Its Two Branches

The **Autonomic Nervous System (ANS)** regulates involuntary bodily functions, including heart rate, respiration, and digestion. It has two primary branches:

**(1) Sympathetic Nervous System (SNS) – “Fight or Flight”**

· Activated by stress and anxiety, increasing heart rate, breathing, and alertness.

**(2) Parasympathetic Nervous System (PNS) – “Rest and Digest”**

· Counteracts stress, slowing heart rate, promoting digestion, and inducing relaxation.

A key player in activating the **parasympathetic response** is the **vagus nerve**, which extends from the brainstem and influences the heart, lungs, and digestive system. **Stimulating the vagus nerve** signals the body to switch from a stress state to a relaxed state.

# Diaphragmatic Breathing: Activating the “Rest and Digest” Response

**Diaphragmatic breathing** (also called belly breathing) **directly engages the parasympathetic nervous system**, overriding the stress-induced fight-or-flight response. By slowing and deepening your breath, you stimulate the **vagus nerve**, which lowers heart rate, reduces muscle tension, and promotes a sense of calm.

**How to Practice (Lying Down Position):**

**(1) Lie on your back** in a comfortable position.

**(2) Hand placement:**

· Place **one hand on your chest**.

· Slide the **other hand below the sternum** and rest it palm-down on your upper abdomen (**diaphragm**).

**(3) Breathing mechanics:**

· Inhale **slowly through the nose**, filling your belly with air.

· Keep the **chest hand still**—only the **diaphragm hand should move up and down**.

· Imagine your belly button **gently pressing toward your spine** as you inhale. **Exhale slowly** through the nose or pursed lips, letting the belly deflate.

· **Key points:**

\*\*The **chest hand must remain stationary**—movement should come from the belly.  
\*\***Practice when calm** to master the technique before using it in anxious moments.  
\*\*Once comfortable, you can use diaphragmatic breathing **while sitting, walking, or even jogging**.

# How Many Breaths?

Relief varies by person, but **15-20 deep cycles** often bring noticeable relaxation. Some may experience a **brief lag time** between finishing the exercise and feeling calm.

**3. Managing Somatic Anxiety: Engaging the Body to Regain Calm**

# What Is Somatic Anxiety? (vs. Cognitive Anxiety)

Anxiety manifests in **two primary ways**:

**(1) Cognitive Anxiety** – Characterized by **excessive worrying, racing thoughts, and mental distress.**

**(2) Somatic Anxiety** – Anxiety **felt in the body**, often presenting as **tightness in the chest, stomach discomfort, muscle tension, dizziness, or shortness of breath.**

While cognitive anxiety is more **thought-based**, **somatic anxiety** is rooted in **physical sensations** triggered by **autonomic nervous system activity**—particularly **sympathetic arousal (""fight or flight"").**

**Where is somatic anxiety usually felt?**

I**t is commonly experienced in the torso**, including the **chest, stomach, diaphragm, and sometimes the throat**—areas where the **autonomic nervous system** has strong physiological effects.

# Option 1: Diaphragmatic Breathing (First-Line Intervention)

**Since** **somatic anxiety is body-based**, **body-based interventions work best.**

  
**Diaphragmatic breathing**, as previously described, directly engages the **parasympathetic nervous system**, signaling the body to shift from **""fight or flight"" to ""rest and digest.""**

· **Slows breathing and heart rate**

· **Reduces muscle tension**

· **Promotes a sense of physical relaxation**

For many people, **this is the fastest and most effective way to counteract somatic anxiety.**

# Option 2: Mindfulness and Its Neurological Basis

While diaphragmatic breathing directly **calms the nervous system**, **mindfulness** works differently—it **shifts how the brain processes anxiety.**

**The Neuroscience of Mindfulness:**

· **Activates the prefrontal cortex**, which regulates emotional responses.

· **Reduces amygdala reactivity**, lowering the intensity of fear and anxiety.

· **Enhances interoception** (awareness of bodily sensations), helping you observe rather than react to discomfort. 

Mindfulness does not **engage the parasympathetic system** the way diaphragmatic breathing does, but it **can reduce the fear of losing control over one’s body and sense of self**, a major feature of GAD.

# Mindfulness Practice for Somatic Anxiety

**(1) Best position**: Sitting or lying down, but can be done anytime, anywhere.

**(2) Use your breathing as an anchor** – Focus on the sound and sensation of your breath.

**(3)Thoughts will arise—this is normal.**

**(4) Do not try to ""empty"" your mind.** Instead, gently return attention to the breath.

**(5) No self-criticism.** Wandering thoughts are part of the process.

# Summary: Choosing the Right Tool

✅ **Diaphragmatic Breathing** – Engages the **parasympathetic nervous system**, providing **direct** relief from somatic anxiety.  
✅ **Mindfulness** – While **not as physiologically calming**, it **reduces fear of losing control** and enhances **a sense of self-boundary**, helping ease distressing GAD symptoms.

Both approaches can be valuable, depending on the situation. **Experiment, evaluate, and refine** to see what works best for you.

  **Depression**

 **Managing Depression: Strategies for Activation and Engagement**

 

Depression is harder to manage than anxiety because it is a **state of underactivation** rather than overactivation. While anxiety involves **excessive autonomic arousal** (which can be calmed with physiological techniques like breathing), depression is characterized by **low dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine**, leading to **fatigue, low motivation, and emotional blunting.** This makes non-medication relief more challenging because the very actions needed for improvement—movement, engagement, and stimulation—are the hardest to initiate.

# Interventions for Managing Depression

# 1. Behavioral Activation (Breaking the Cycle of Inertia)

**What it does:** Trains the brain to associate small actions with **reward and motivation**, counteracting the tendency to withdraw.

**How to do it:** Work! The activity could be intellectual or physical.

**2.** **Social Engagement (Counteracting Isolation and Emotional Blunting)**

**What it does:** Depression often **shuts down** the brain’s social reward system, making interactions feel **draining** rather than fulfilling. But **passive isolation worsens symptoms.**

**How to do it: Direct contact with a friend or family member. When you are not depressed, create a network of people you trust who would be willing to go “live” with you when you are in crisis.**

**3. Grounding Exercise: Engaging the Five Senses to Break Depressive Rumination**

I find that this helps for severe depression.

**What it does:** Depression often pulls attention **inward**, creating **rumination, detachment, and emotional numbness.** Grounding techniques **shift focus outward** by engaging the five senses, helping to **reconnect with the present moment.**

**How to do it (5-4-3-2-1 method):**

**Name 5 things you can see.**

· Look around and describe five objects in detail.

· Example: *“I see a red book with a torn corner, a coffee mug with steam rising, a blue lamp, a wooden chair, and a small crack in the wall.”*

**Name 4 things you can hear.**

· Tune in to background sounds, near or far.

· Example: *“I hear a clock ticking, birds outside, my own breathing, and distant traffic.”*

**Name 3 things you can feel.**

· Focus on physical sensations.

· Example: *“My feet pressing against the floor, the cool air on my skin, the warmth of my sweater.”*

**Name 2 things you can smell.**

· If you can’t smell anything, recall a favorite scent.

· Example: *“I smell fresh laundry and the faint scent of coffee.”*

**Name 1 thing you can taste.**

· Take a sip of water, chew gum, or simply recall a familiar taste.

· Example: *“I taste mint from my toothpaste.”*

**Key Tip:** Say each observation **slowly and deliberately** to fully engage your senses. If needed, repeat the process to deepen the grounding effect.

This exercise helps **redirect attention from depressive thoughts to the external world**, providing a **moment of presence and stability.**

**The way I describe it is that it “gets me out of my head.” When I am depressed the pain is in my head, not my body.**

**I would be very gratified, and it would be helpful for others, if you would report your results here to note any problems or refinements.**

Hey, new here, 25 male.

Sorry in advance, this is going to be a bit long – but I really want to explain my situation in detail.

I've been living with this weird breathing issue for about 5 years. It's a constant, daily urge to take a deep breath through my mouth, like I'm not getting enough air unless I force it. Sometimes, the deep breath doesn't ""go through"" – like it gets stuck, or doesn't feel complete, no matter how hard I try. It’s really frustrating and hard to describe. Sometimes I need to take a deep breath every 30 seconds, sometimes every 2 minutes – it varies. In the morning, I might not even notice it for an hour because I'm not conscious of it, but once I do, I feel it the rest of the day.

**Lately, it's gotten worse**. For the past month especially, it's been almost nonstop. I yawn more than usual, and when I’m feeling really bad, even the yawns don’t feel like they’re working. The sensation is tiring, and it’s been ruining my sleep – there were 3 nights this month where I just couldn’t sleep at all because of it.

The first time I ever felt this was after I had two teeth removed. I was given a medication that really messed me up – I couldn’t sleep for almost two nights and felt extremely bad and anxious. Around that time I started noticing this breathing issue. Then during the first COVID wave (it was really close to my teeth removed),I think it came back more intensely or I started to notice it firstly this time, I don't really remember – I was very anxious about the virus.

Also, I've been diagnosed with seasonal allergies for a long time – especially to tree pollen like birch, and grasses. Both are very high where I live. I'm going to start a pollen desensitization in September. My ENT thinks it could be related to my allergies, like it might be an allergic spasm in my bronchi, but I’ve been on all the necessary treatments for asthma and allergies for years now, and I still experience this issue.

Also – and I don’t know if this is related – I’ve had dandruff for a long time, but this past month it’s been much worse, especially on the sides of my scalp near my face. It seems to flare up after really bad nights.

I’ve seen a pulmonologist and ENT. I did lung function tests (EFR) and everything came back normal. I’ve been told it could be hyperventilation syndrome or anxiety, but I’m not convinced that’s the whole story.

A month ago I went through what I think was an emotional burnout, I burst into tears for no reason and my legs won't stop shaking. Since then, my mental health has declined. I saw a doctor yesterday – he said I’m showing signs of mild depression (score of 10 on the Hamilton scale – I retook it myself after it and scored 12). He prescribed Xanax for nights when I feel overwhelmed and can’t sleep, and told me to see a psychotherapist, which I'm going to consult, I just need to find a good one that I can reach easily.

I’ve never smoked, drank alcohol, or used any drugs.

If anyone out there has experienced the same kind of persistent ""air hunger,"" deep breath that doesn’t satisfy, or yawns that don’t go through – please let me know. Especially if you’ve found something that helped, whether it's therapy, breathing exercises, medication, anything.

Hello, I want to get straight to the point.



I have a feeling that I don't know what it is and it makes me feel very bad, please let me explain, in my old times I was not a very social person, I was even bullied, at least as far as I remember, I was always on the computer and I could do anything I wanted (on the internet) very easily. my father and mother must have noticed something, (they will tell me when I grow up) they enrolled me in a football club to socialize. There I experienced communication, friendship and the feeling of being part of a team. I was also very good at soccer, so much so that the infrastructure of my city transferred me. 

 I was a person who socialized very well, I used to fulfill my responsibilities and then I used to pray to Allah, I used to trust. But after a certain day, these things are completely gone, I don't want to say the name of the country I'm in right now. My country is in a bad situation and as a young person I'm worried about the future, when I say depression (I realize that I've passed these places quickly, sir.) I don't want to badmouth my country, although my country has many bad sides. Even now, as I am writing this, I wonder if you are going to question how long I am writing, if you are going to criticize me, I can't stop. I started university, I started a 2-year associate degree program, I was going to transfer to a 4-year university. but I started to feel so bad that this is the main issue (please don't say anything, I wanted to summarize the previous parts so that you can understand me a little).  

The first months of my university were very good, I was enjoying life despite the country I was in, until then I wasn't someone who cared what people thought about me, even if they did I would say I don't care, I would do well. My financial situation is not good and I can't buy clothes, but I hope I will find a job and buy them, it got to the point that I started not going to school and I didn't say anything to my parents about it because people would say about me “she always wears the same things, look at her”. I couldn't say that I wasn't going to school and now I find myself extending it to the 4th year and I tell myself that if I don't go to university I have to get a job, I have to earn money.

 But even there I am afraid of how they will criticize me before I even get the job, how ignorant I am (of course the knowledge I have gained here will help me) and so I start to think that I will not pass the job interview and I am afraid to start the job, so much so that I cannot even go to starbucks, I have to have a friend with me.



 I never used to talk about such things before and I used to be surprised and upset at those who did because they did not have their own principles (only in myself without saying anything to them) because I thought it was a sign of weakness, but now I find myself in this issue and I see myself as the person who can at least get out of this situation, I want to see it. I'm trying to open a topic and solve it, right? When I see the messages opened, I hope we can find a solution to this by talking. 

I'm in an incredibly bad period, I'm trying to live waiting for a day when everything will be good. now I'm addicted to social media, when I reread my posts I realized that I have a focus problem, I feel so bad that on the one hand I think I know my mistakes and I think I can solve these issues so I relax but then the same thing happens again. I have a procrastination disease, I postpone everything until I realize that it is a mistake when the time comes, I have this mindset now, but despite that I can't do anything. How do you mobilize yourself, even the thought of counting backwards for 5 seconds and suddenly getting up and doing it doesn't work. Thank you for listening.

Example that happened to me about an hour ago: I was feeling tired and falling asleep. My mind started to ruminate on a random shopping trip I took yesterday. Nothing bad happened during the trip but for some reason my mind began to alter the memory in a way that made it seem like I had crashed my car while parking in the parking lot. I “woke” up in a fright and to a mini anxiety attack where I had to repeatedly convince myself that I did not actually crash my car. Not even close. Even while I was trying to convince myself that it never happened, another part of my brain kept berating me for being so stupid  as to park in that specific spot and that it was inevitable that I would have an accident. 

This is not the first time this has happened. Usually it happens when I’m close to falling asleep but not always. It’s like my mind is playing tricks on me, turning any regular event or interaction into one where something horrible happens. Sometimes I have to slap myself just to snap myself out of the loop.

I am finally able to get out of the house. I am eating again and better than I did. I am more active. But I still have the underlying fear and paranoia that it’s all temporary. 

 Having panic disorder has been one of the hardest trials of my life. When it first started it was out of the blue and would happen multiple times a week leading to multiple ER visits. I am not proud of it and the staff hated to see me coming. I used the hospital as a crutch, if I was dying they could save me. Well about a year I believe it was into my diagnosis I was on medication that helped and it was somewhat under control. I had a lot of break through but no where near as when it had started. I was in nursing school and studying with a group of classmates on zoom. Eating spicy cheese itz because I was an awful snacking college student. When in the middle of our session I experienced a weird sensation in my sternum. It was a weird sensation but I can never forget the immediate panic that took over after. It was painful and like a hard pressure. I thought one of the chips just hit me wrong but it just got worse. I had my fiance drop me off at the ER. Where I was shoved into a back room with the diagnosis of anxiety and didn’t see anyone. I remember my arm tingling and my jaw feeling tight and electrified. The pressure on my chest was so hard that I couldn’t sit up. Like something was physically holding me down. I blacked out sometime after and woke up in my bed. My fiance had come back and got me and I remembered none of it. 
This was about 3 years ago now and I’ve never pursued further help with that particular experience. I was looked at like I was crazy enough that I fully believed I experienced a new level of panic that perfectly simulated what I would imagine a heart attack would be like. 

At the time I didn’t eat the best. Mainly not enough. I was around 100 lbs (and would continue to drop into the 90s) and 3 years post partum. I had a lot of mental struggles dealing with the anxiety and depression. 

Today I’m no longer on daily meds. I’m eating more healthy balanced foods. My snacking habits are also healthier. I still cave for the occasional fast food but my diet is overall better than back then.  I’ve gained 15-20lbs which is huge for me after years of struggling with weight gain. I’m holding down a full time job again and it is stressful one but it keeps my mind distracted and I’m constantly moving and active. 

I obviously have no long term side effects of this incident. My palpitations are anxiety caused. I have no reason to be so hyper focused on one incident. It didn’t take me out, I am still here. It could have been a panic attack and a severe one at that. And yet I’m sitting here imagining just dropping one day and leaving my daughter without a mom because I just can’t control my brain. At the end of the day not being here for her terrifies me. I don’t know how to shut off these depressive nonsensical thoughts. I should be happy that I have made it this far.

This is just a vent post, so do with it what you will. Anyways.

I usually sleep really poorly, as I'm falling asleep around eleven/eleven-thirty and waking up at six. I could sleep worse, but it's hard because I'm currently in school. I wake up each morning and I feel exhausted. Part of it is anemia but a lot more comes from being anxious as I'm lying in bed.

As I'm going to bed, I often look around in the dark and think that someone could be standing just outside my door or my window watching me. I'm scared to get up and use the bathroom at night sometimes or to open my closet and change if I'm hot because I'm scared someone will be hiding there.

Don't get me wrong. I love the nighttime. I always have. I love the way that the stars and moon become visible at night. I love the feeling of being wrapped tightly in blankets to go to sleep. I love darkness.

But as I've gotten older, I feel less and less able to sleep, even in the peace of the night. I can't sleep well if I can see any door — closet door or bedroom door (if it's dark outside of my room) — open in the nighttime. If I can, I just know that someone is standing there in the dark, waiting to harm me if I get out of bed.

I hate people touching my bed. My family is moving to New Zealand and our realtor touched my bed and pillow and blankets, and it gives me so much anxiety because I know that her germs (even though I'm sure her hands were clean) touched my bed. My bed feels like the only safe place in my house at night because if I stay in bed, I know no one can hurt me. But I still feel so much anxiety when I try to sleep even though my bed feels safe. What if I must use the bathroom at night? What if I need to grab a stuffed animal that fell off my bed? What if I need to pace because I can't sleep?

I take melatonin, but I'm not on meds so I can't do anything about this creeping anxiety when I'm trying to sleep. Melatonin can't put me to sleep. It takes over an hour for me to fall asleep, whether I take it or not. I might be lying here for two and half hours because I just can't sleep. My only idea is that SSRIs might help because serotonin is involved in sleep. My mom doesn't believe me, though, that my anxiety is this bad.

I don't know how to express to my mom that my anxiety is really bad. I have words, but I can't say them whenever she asks. She has a tendency to ask as if it's a challenge to me. It's a challenge I feel I can't beat. I have a hard time expressing my thoughts aloud, so here's my explanation that I wish I could give: 

I can't control my anxiety. I always feel this sense of creeping doom. At some point, this impending doom will be very present doom. It will hit and I won't be able to do anything about it. I don't sleep well because I'm afraid that someone is waiting for me to get out of bed so that they can do something bad to me. I want to be able to control it. I want to be able to sleep and study with more ease. I want to not be scared and see a need to hide all the time. I'm scared that you'll for, that I'll die, that one of my sisters will die, that dad will die, that someone will be kidnapped or assaulted or a billion other things. I'll fail my classes. You'll hate me if I don't do everything perfectly. You'll hate me if I make a single mistake. I know it's not true, any of my fears, but they're not just fears to deny their reality and move on. They're in my head. I can't face them and won't because they'll always win, even if I manage to hold it off temporarily.

I wake up s lot of mornings with a feeling of impending doom. So far, doom hasn't met us in any of the ways I feared and fear. But the feelings there when I wake. I think most of my issues would be stopped by an SSRI medication: born depression and anxiety symptoms would hopefully be at least somewhat reduced, which would be a huge improvement.

But Mom doesn't get my problems. She doesn't understand the extent of the anxiety or the severity. And my dad won't have me on medications without my mom's approval as well.

I just want to be able to sleep, y'all. I want to be able to sleep without fearing that horrible things will happen while I'm sleeping. I don't want the constant feelings of doom.

I'm scared of how I'd change on medication — anxiety affects all parts of my life so it feels like it's a very major part of me. What will be left if I'm not anxious anymore?

I always got a bit paranoid when I started smoking but that was because it was shit weed and I was only just getting used to it. I then started smoking cigs and for some reason weed got suddenly better as well. 
About two years ago i stopped for a while to focus on my a levels. Then I smoked again, only to then green out and think too much about the bigger picture of life. Nowadays that’s all I think about. I look to the sky and I get shivers, thinking about death. The unavoidable feeling that there’s no certainty and I can’t do anything to change. I understand that I can’t change and that I should just live, but for me it just scares me. I never had this problem though when I was smoking though, both cigs and weed. I was carefree. Now if I smoke I prang about everything. Im looking to take meds for my anxiety so I’m hoping that they help me fall in love with weed again and forget about drinking and pills/powders because I never originally wanted to drink or do drugs, just smoke pot. I get that people will say I shouldn’t smoke anymore and it’s best I just give it up, but all of my friends smoke and it’s just healthier.

He has anxiety and it has made him question this relationship many times, which then causes me to question it too.

It's very confusing cause he can be so lovely, caring, he even said I love yous for the first time earlier this year. Then he relapsed into smoking weed again and it triggered his anxiety all over again. He had decided to cut it in January and things were so great between us, but after he smokes he becomes emotionally distant.

He's still fairly consistent, checks on me everyday, plans dates, is affectionate, compliments me, calls sometimes, sex life is great etc. Basically he's a good boyfriend. But when he's on some sort of weed hangover (that can last weeks or more) it feels like he's there but his heart isn't.

I wonder if I should cut my losses or if I should be more patient. It's a very confusing place to be cause when I let him know the ambivalence is too much to me some days, he understands his actions are sabotaging the relationship, then gets his act together, things get better for a while, then gradually he's back to some emotional numbness/distance. And that hurts.

There are also some retroactive jealousy feelings involved on my side, cause he told me a while ago abt an ex from a while ago who he gave his all for, then she dumped him, and since then he hasn't been able to fully surrender into other relationships. 

Doesn't help that I too have an ex who I had the most wonderful relationship with too, and I had done an okay job of getting over him when I got with my current bf. But this push and pull makes me miss the stability of the previous relationship.

I would really like some advice from someone impartial and not related to me so here it goes....
My older sister invited me to go on a trip to florida for the week. On a whim, she found dirt cheap tickets and hotel so i just said okay in the moment. 1) because its her birthday that week 2) I dont want her going alone 3) She is using this trip to escape our amityville house (we call it that b/c it turns you evil once you go in), crazy mom.  She does this when she really wants to get away and i dont want her being alone with her thoughts cause i know shes in a bad place (not suicidal, but definitely depressed)....the problem is that i agreed spontaneously and its hard to feel happy that im going because my husnand and i just moved and spent a lot of money to replace furniture, houseware, etc. Lately the amount of money i make and the constant spending on the new place has me feeling guilty for whatever i want to do outside of that.

I felt guilty about agreeing to go but i justified its okay because my sister shouldnt go alone on her birthday, its not that i wanted a vacation, its not a good week to miss work at the hospital but then i told myself ""its never going to be a good time to miss work b/c its always busy""    But TODAY she casually starts talking about her issues with our mom and says she kind of ""shouldnt be going on the trip""   it triggered me because i felt immediately the trip became pointless if we both have regrets. Then after she says ""you dont have to come, its just the flight money you lose""   that kind of careless sentence made me even more angry, she doesnt care if i dont come and knowing im low on funds, i should just throw away money. I couldnt stop the worrying and anger once she said that. Its not just the money thing but I cant grasp that now i have a decision to make and both routes give me anxiety.

Now im in a whole mess of my mind questioning why im going on this trip. I want to cancel but idk if its my anger/anxiety influencing me to cancel.  im extremely indecisive and i dont want my emotions to ruin all of this. I dont know whats worse, going on a trip knowing my sister doesnt care if i last minute bail or staying home and explaining to everyone why because i got too emotional after one discussion.",Negative,Low Concern,florida,"(27.7567667, -81.4639835)",27.7567667,-81.4639835

It happens, and so many little things happened that ended up reaching my peak. Never seen before. In fact... my peak was a few years ago when I was around 12 years old, I don't have a good memory for those dates, but it was when I put a knife to my neck, but I didn't kill myself, because then I wouldn't be writing this message, right? 

(The jokes help ease the tension, sorry about them hehehehe)

I spent the night today (it's 11am, I woke up at 12am yesterday) awake, trying to help people, from this subreddit and r/depression, I tried to be a quick response help, even though I'm as in the shit as everyone else. I felt useful, even though I didn't help in the best way, I consider that having someone trying to help is something necessary. I was happy :)
 I ended up coming across the case of a girl, who asked me a question that I couldn't answer, because every time I tried, I realized that my text was bigger and bigger, with more detours and uncertainties, I started trying to write something at 4 am, I finished it at 10 am. This really hit me, I actually found one, or maybe more than one monster that terrifies me, I didn't take the time to look at them so well and understand them.
They scare me, they make me want to kill myself, seem like a good option, and honestly I'm so at peace, I would die, right now, smiling and calm.
I guess that's why I'm not crying now, I'm not seeing problems in death, even though I know she has them. I don't think I'm going to kill myself because it would require a will, and I don't think I have that will, much less the tools I would desire. I would like it to be something simple, quick and painless, so I wouldn't have to go through what I think I will have to go through in life. I don't feel good living. It's not healthy for me. And I would like to die 🙂, I think that's more what I'm going through now",Positive,High-Risk,,"(None, None)",,

I remember when I started taking the medication — I was only 17, dealing with anxiety and OCD. Like everyone else, I just wanted to feel ‘normal’ again, to feel like I did before, but that never really happened… until I started taking escitalopram.

The first two weeks were intense, but then I started feeling better — a bit of peace in my head. In the end, I was just a scared kid who wanted to feel okay. After a few months, things improved, and I started feeling normal. I felt calm and good, but also a bit numb and unmotivated, which is a side effect of the medication. You don’t feel bad, but you don’t feel great either — it dulls your emotions. But I didn’t care, I kept going.

Eventually, I reached a point where I thought I didn’t need it anymore, so I started tapering off. I stopped abruptly because I felt fine and wanted to feel that way without the pill. At first, I still felt okay — but no one had warned me about the withdrawal syndrome. Not even the doctor. That’s when I realized it had just been a patch for the anxiety, not a cure, and I started to understand things more clearly. Withdrawal syndrome usually causes a lot of anxiety and other symptoms. And for you that are here trying to try medication or that is passing the withdrawal symptoms. The problem is the doubt — not knowing whether it’s that or something else — may have affected. I recommend, as someone who has taken this pill, that you stop taking it and be strong. If millions have done it… you can too. Remember that pharmaceutical companies just want more money and to keep people medicated. It’s important that you understand this is just anxiety — which you already had even before taking the antidepressant. (Sorry for my English I speak Spanish)

There are people who are genuinely helped by it, no doubt, but they are much less than half, and that’s often because of the placebo effect. Doctors will tell you, “Yes, it’s definitely good to take medication, it’s a chemical imbalance in the brain,” but that’s not true! It’s really your overactive nervous system keeping you in fight-or-flight mode — as if there’s a lion in front of you that doesn’t exist, and your mind is trying to protect you from it. I recommend exercising, even if it’s hard. Stop searching on Reddit or Google. I’m here too because I’m also tapering off the medication, and I like to see how others are going through this hard time. But I’ve realized something: everyone seems to go through it in a similar way, and yet each of us has the ability to educate ourselves and face our own mind. It’s crucial to understand that this is temporary and requires a lot of patience, and to not stop doing what you truly want to do — as long as it’s something positive.

Ask any psychiatrist or psychologist if they’ve ever cured a patient, and most likely they won’t know how to answer — because anxiety, OCD, and depression aren’t cured with pills. Medication treats the symptoms, not the cause. And if there’s no apparent cause, it’s probably your thoughts — the ones you give too much value and importance to.

I’ll never forget the time I thought, “What if I hurt someone I love?” (an OCD thought). That mental trap — validating whether I was really capable of doing that — terrified me, and I started avoiding the thoughts. But that’s the real problem: avoiding them because of that mental trap. And believe it or not, everyone has those thoughts — they just don’t give them importance.

In the end, it’s all up to you — not a pill or a therapist. It sounds rough, but it’s possible. Instead of reading things on Reddit, look for stories of how people recovered from anxiety and how they faced it. Those Reddit posts are often written by people lying in bed, full of anxiety, doing nothing to get out of it — just waiting for the medicine to kick in or for something to magically change, but that doesn’t work. What works is being active, doing things you know are good for you — over and over again. It’s like taking your brain to the gym. You have to train it, and it’s rare to see immediate results at first. It takes time. The best thing is to accept where you are, stop fighting your mind (because that only makes it worse), and understand it. Understand that it’s just on high alert — and just like you entered this, you can get out of it.

I love you because I understand you, and we’re all going to get through this. ALL of us. God bless you.”",Positive,Low Concern,,"(None, None)",,

At this point this is where the anxiety attack hit me. I started to convince myself I was having a heart attack and rushed to my parents to make sure I was okay. They were able to calm me down a bit but the feeling still persist throughout the rest of the day. Flash forward to now, this feeling has still persisted.

I just wanted to explain what I've been going through before I bid this subreddit adieu for the day.

I've been having awful anxiety attacks for the past few months...or maybe, more. Yeah, definitely more. I was worried about what the outcome of the presidential elections here would be for the sole reason that one side winning would mean trouble for my eligibility for the Total and Permanent Disability Discharge for relief from federal student loans. Well, the troublesome side won. I even repeatedly said that if one side won, then I would get a master's degree and wait to apply, and that I wouldn't get a master's degree if the troublesome side won.

Here's the thing, though. I really want a master's degree. So, I got the necessary paperwork from my local Social Security Administration office in mid-November, and I promptly applied. In late December, I made the stupid mistake of taking out another loan because I really, really want a master's degree! In mid to late January, I received a letter saying that I was approved for the TPD Discharge, but I already knew that I undid that approval by taking out the new loan.

When I learned that I wouldn't be able to apply for the TPD Discharge again until sometime in March because of a transition set forth by the Biden administration to move the TPD Discharge from being under Nelnet, a private company, to being under the Office of Federal Student Aid, I started having awful panic attacks! In February, my mother helped me with my anxiety by uselessly mailing a new application overnight to Nelnet. 

Well, a few days before I saw that applications opened again, my reaction with my best friend was SCARY! My best friend offered me virtual hugs, which of course, I greatly appreciated! So, now, I made the necessary phone calls, and I've been told that my new application will take up to 90 days. I was told that I can call again after those 90 days have passed. Well, there's nothing that I can do about all this now. I did what I had to do, and I am absolutely not taking out any further federal student loans!

In fact, I just got an email from my school because I met the eligibility requirements for a donor scholarship. I sure applied for that scholarship as soon as I saw the email!",Positive,Low Concern,,"(None, None)",,

Hello Everyone,

I don't really know how to summarize or where to start exactly but I know that I just need to get this out.

I am 25 and I live with my family

A couple years ago my Mom violated a personal boundary and I have never felt alright about her ever since. Honestly I think I just tried to forget about it. I told myself it wasn't a big deal. That my Mom at the end of the day really cares about me and tries her best and I thought I could get over it. I have been alright for the most part since then but I find myself struggling to being sympathetic and patient with my Mom. Lately when she gets confused while talking to me and I have to explain things over and over I get really frustrated and short with her. I kept thinking what the hell is wrong with me? Why can't I show my own mother some patience and kindness. I've smoked a lot of weed for years both medicinally and recreational and I think that may have made it easier to try and put what happened in the back of mind. The truth is I know why I'm struggling.

Essentially one night maybe 2-3 years ago my older brother, his girlfriend at the time, and myself where sitting at a table in the kitchen at night. I was on my laptop, possibly with headphones on listening to some stuff. I think I started listening to something because my Mom had arrived home drunk and I get really uncomfortable around my Mom when she's drunk.

She's very unpredictable. Sometimes she'll be very self conscious and will be very quick to ask if your judging her. She can get real nasty very quick. Some times she'll be sad and tell me I have to take care of my little brother and ask me to never put her in a nursing home. Sometimes she'll talk my ear off about her night and what she did with all her friends. Sometimes she'll be real sentimental. She'll ask me to make her something to eat, because I make the best food according to her. She can also get very touchy feeling and want hugs, or gives kisses. It's innocent, it's a mother expressing a love for her child. I tell myself this but it makes me deeply uncomfortable when she does this when she's drunk.

This particular night she came up behind me gave me a hug. She wrapped her arms around my wast and pressed her face into the back of my neck. Maybe she said I love you or something too I don't remember. Then she started kissing my neck slowly over and over again. Just pecks, I guess but she kept doing it. It made me so uncomfortable so quickly. I felt sick. She didn't stop and kept going and kept her arms around my waist. She did it right in front of my older brother and his girlfriend. I'm not upset at them for not saying anything, maybe it seemed harmless? Idk 

I just ripped her arms off me and said stop 

She seemed shocked and so did my brother and GF, they asked me if I was alright and I think I said I was okay but what just happened made me really uncomfortable 

She went upstairs right after without saying anything

The next day she sobered up and asked me what happened. I can't remember if she asked if I didn't want her to touch me at all or if she wanted to know what happened precisely.

I just told her that her kissing my neck and holding me from behind made me uncomfortable and she apologized. I think maybe she understood that I needed space or she asked me for a hug and I said no. I tried to put it behind me because we had that little chat but I have never felt the same since that night. I have never looked at her the same since that night.

That night I probably should have just went up to my room. I feel dumb that I didn't because then none of this would have happened and I could have avoided all of this. I knew that to be around her when she is drunk is to have to interact with her at some point. I knew that if I wanted to avoid her I should just remove myself from wherever she is in the house. I didn't and I know I should not blame myself, I just really wish I hadn't stayed in the kitchen. I hate feeling this way.

I have these feelings of disgust. I can't stand when she touches me or asks for a hug. Even if I need a hug and I ask for one it still feels awful

Even though we briefly talked about it and she apologized I'm still not over it and I feel bad about that.

She's getting older. My older brother and myself are put down as the people who will care for and make decisions for our parents when they get older and gradually lose their facilities. I often get frustrated with my Mom. 

It should be noted that at some point within I believe the past five years she had a brain aneurysm . It has not burst but it has impacted her mental facilities. She is able to maintain a corporate job that is remote at home which is very mentally taxing. It was not made clear to me that she experienced this and I did not really understand how her brain may have been impacted. The first time she mentioned this she was drunk and she implied it was potentially hereditary and apologized. She said she had leaky arteries in her brain, but I was very confused. 

I only recently became aware that she has some brain damage and how that impacts her now. Recently we were in the car running errands and I discussed how I was feeling irritable and like I was lacking patience. She agreed and said she noticed and feels I have been really short with her. I agree with her I don't think she's wrong. She asked me if that will change in the future, if I will change and be sweet with her. I found that I could not say yes, I genuinely did not know if my feeling would go away and if it would be easier for me to be kind. I thought either that or I would need to suck it up and that's not good for me mentally to bottle things up like that.  I got quiet and did not answer because I did not want to say yes because I did not know that is was true. She said maybe she should take me off the list of people that get to look after her if I don't change. 

I really thought about my behavior. I remembered what happened more clearly that night with my Mom. 

In my adolescence I was sexually molested by my male friends on different occasions. I have also been groped by men through out my life. My home, it felt like a sanctuary. I felt safe. I felt like no matter what happened out in the world or in the past, I was safe from having anything like that happen while I live here with my family.

I tried to tell myself she hadn't done something as severe as the perpetrators of my past so I should just let it go, but it is still fucking with me. That moment broke that idea. Why? Why would she do that? Why did she do that? I have to be fine with it so things can be normal again. She knows about everything that happened to me, how could she do that? It's not that bad she didn't rape me 

During my early childhood my mother would get very short with me. She would spank me, hit me, grab me and yell at me, ridicule and mock me. There are so many different memories and instances of times where she just absolutely scared the shit out of me as a child and it lead to me getting very depressed and suicidal. I didn't see her as some one to go to. I also didn't really talk to my Dad about anything. He would not be sympathetic and often defend my Mom. Things got really bad and eventually a fellow student told a councilor they were concerned about me. I broke down and that lead to years of therapy and hard conversations with my family. It was hard, I felt so raw and desperate and sad for a long time. I did get better and things improved with my family.

I know that I struggle to show my Mom patience and kindness because a part of me is bitter that she did not show patience to me as a child consistently. We formed an unhealthy cycle of her apologizing promising to be better and then inevitably snapping again and breaking her promise. She later stopped promising and just said she would try. She beats her self up and regrets what she did. She is a lot better now and medicated. She's apologized profusely, she would apologize over and over again, I told her to stop apologizing because I didn't want to remember all the times she hurt me. No amount of apology stops her from flagellating herself.

My father understands when my mom fucks up and even supports me when shes not around. He never stuck up for me in front of her and no matter what she's done he always tells me that at the end of the day she is my best support and number #1 fan. He is correct and I still love her. I do not hate her, it hurts to see her grow old and think about her dying, I know I'm going to miss her.

I have not told him about how Mom violated that boundary one night and made me feel uncomfortable, I am doubtful anything worthwhile would really come from it. 

My older brother tells me I need to find a way to come to terms with it and be there for my Mom. He is definitely quick to defend her and often undermine my emotions and feelings. He tells me that regardless of how I feel I will regret not doing right by my Mom. I think he's right and maybe projecting a little. 

I know that I am going to try to talk to a therapist at least. It will take some time to be able to see one due to everyone being booked these days, but I am still going to try.

I understand that I have these conflicting feelings and issues that cannot be solved on my own or with the power of friendship. I don't really feel like it would be worthwhile or helpful to bring this up with my Mother. There have been times where I have expressed not wanting to be touched and then sometime later my Dad told tell me I shouldn't do that because it makes my Mom feel like I'm flinching like she's gonna hit me /hurt's her feelings and she's really sensitive so I should be nicer.

In regards to that I am at a complete lose. I don't know what to do. I feel like I'm kinda going crazy. Like maybe it isn't that bad and I'm just making a big deal out of nothing. At the same time I know how gross I felt and how that has impacted my view of my mother. That's not nothing, it has changed me. I think therapy will help me figure out how to take steps to feel better about this but until then I'm just a drift in these emotions.

Nothing I ever do matters. 

Thats it. That is the post.

Ive had low self esteem for pretty much all my life. Some of it was bullying from others and othertimes it was from within my family. 
I have nvld, so while Im neurodivergent and developed differently than other kids, I came off as """"smarter"""" because I had a huge vocabulary which is common for nvld kids. And because I got on the internet WAY too early as a kid, I also had a lot more political knowledge than my peers. 

People bullied me for being fat, ugly, having poor social skills, but not one ever bullied me for my intelligence and it was for a reason. 

But we all grow up, and for me growing up meant gaining an ED and trying to look prettier. I dropped 30 lbs within three or two months at 11. I was no longer the girl that kids would call fat, I was the girl that other girls came to for diet advice. (Hope to god they never took it.) And after that, after seeing people admire me, I put all of my ego into my looks.

I get to highschool and life becomes more serious. I had a huge fear of death that I gained around this time too, and entered what I would call an ""early life crisis"". The idea of never existing again and being forever forgotten, and my existence being totally meaningless, is the most horrifying concept to me. I can't even use religion to help cope, because religion makes it worse.

 I knew from day 1 I wanted a science degree badly. I drifted to psychology, and I did very well in both my psych classes and sociology classes. But then I took biology, and it gripped me by the neck. I loved it. I knew that I needed to be a biologist, and I needed to do something meaningful, and then I could die. 

I sacrificed everything to get my good grades. I sacrificed my health. I neglected sleep, my diet, exercise, everything. I would wake up in the morning, and I would drowsily remember the parts of active transport.

I got great grades in bio, and I felt so happy with myself. My ego based in looks then came to being based in intelligence.

Then summer came and I entered the worse depression I ever had in years. What I did to my body to acheive greatness wrecked me. I couldnt sleep properly and everything was all out of whack. But the only thing keeping me sane was my good grades. I believed that the way I set things up, this year would be easier, and I could go to university.

School started again. And I was kicked down repeatedly, and the depression only worsened.

I found out that because of my math difficulties and the fact I took a non academic math course when I was 14, now I can't go to university without going to community college. Further more I can't take precal, which helps me get that degree.

All of my accomplishments from last year were pretty much forgotten about and rendered irrelevant.

Every single teacher, admin, etc. Was telling me not to go to university for a science degree because of my math issues from my disability. They all told me to essentially give up. Its double frustrating to hear that, and then hear all these speeches from teachers about ""limiting yourself.""

When I got diagnosed with adhd, my psychologist said the same. And when I looked at my intelligence results..they were pretty bad. It was not a formal IQ test exactly, but it was similar. I scored pretty low on reading comprehension, when I never had that pointed out in the past and I have always excelled in english. 

I struggled so much in the first semester that my english grade was the lowest it has ever been. I had to get rid of a free period this semester to make it up for my applications. (I passed, it just was not high enough) 
The main high grades I got was in politics and family studies in the first semester.

Now I am in the second. And biology class is making me feel worse about myself. My teacher is a harsh grader. I dont hate him, hes trying to do his job, but thats how it is. While I love bio it has become something I dread. Because every bad mark on a test makes me feel suicidal because I am not fufilling my purpose. Before going into class yesterday I had to cry in my car and walk in with a really red face. It feels like even though I turn in every single assignment, and do the work, im too dumb and nothing sticks and I don't remember anything because of how much I have fucked up my brain.  

I am tired and exhausted every single day. I don't hang out with people outside of school anymore. I don't go out like I used to. All I do is sleep, cry, or bedrot in my freetime when I am not wrestling myself over homework or studying. All I do is sleep when I get home.

Nothing I ever do matters.

I do all the work, all of my assignments. I show up on time. But my ""best"" is never enough, unless I sacrifice myself enough to the point of me becoming unhealthier and unhealthier. And even that, it is just enough.

I have come to realize that all that sacrificing i did only gave me a B (80-85%) last year. That is it. Thats not remarkable. That is embarassing. 

I look at myself in the mirror and I feel I look unrecognizable. My hair is dry, my eyes feel sunken in, I look older and dull. I feel ugly and stupid, just like my brain. 
I am starting to give up. Infact I probably already did subconciously. I just feel too tired to try anymore when these are the results I get despite me taking off years of my lifespan. But now I don't know what to do with my life that is worth living, and I wish I could just stay in bed forever if im not worthy of being here.",Negative,Low Concern,,"(None, None)",,

I'm really close to walking away.,"I'm so bitter and angry. I'm really close to walking away. Dude I don't know the fuck else you want from me. I've bled myself dry and I'm honestly not any happier for the effort, I'm just more exhausted and more alone than ever. I put in 110%, 24/7 and I try to think of every little thing but it just doesn't fucking matter. I try to communicate and I get shut down with shitty tones and defensiveness and aggression. I ask for more time and attention and it's asking too much, so I back off but as soon as you're lonely I'm not doing enough and I've just misconstrued the very clear words you said to me. I ask for support but then I'm just told I'm ungrateful for not falling over myself with gratitude for the breadcrumbs I get. I jump at the opportunity to try to help but it's never in the right way. Hell I just ask you to be in the same room with me or attempt to hold a conversation in a normal, non-shitty tone in the little time I do get with you, and somehow that's a problem too. Forget dates and gestures and romance, I let that dream die months ago. It's been almost a year since you said you'd take me on one, singular date and it still hasn't happened. 


You take me for granted. I would weep with gratitude if anybody offered to make my appointments or bring comfort into my life, or take any little thing off my plate, or hell just give me one easy fucking week when I'm grieving. I put forth my best while so much shit is happening but it's never enough or never exactly how you want it. Somehow you always find a way to be upset or offended or take things personally and make sure I feel like shit. You want so much grace for being lazy but when I ask for the tiniest bit of grace for myself while shit is hitting the fan in my life somehow I'm ""throwing it in your face"". I can't get one single fucking week of sanity without you coming at me aggressively and expecting me to read your mind. And yes, you are aggressive and belligerent and you can't fucking regulate your emotions like an adult. Honestly sometimes it's embarrassing to be seen with you when you choose to be a petulant child over every little thing. 


You have all the time in the world to figure your shit out and you just fucking refuse. Your job isn't demanding, all you do at home is sit around. You don't put in any effort to actually improve your life. Even basic shit like insuring your car or wiping your snot rockets off the shower wall that I cleaned is too big of an ask. You say you want to work but it really only seems like you want to work until you've built a reputation that will let you coast and then you give up completely. You say you want involved friends but ""you're a follower"" so you never actually initiate plans. You get invited to things, you're just so fucking unpleasant to be around that you don't get invited back (I know this to be true because they've told me). You ""want a real job"" but I can't blame management for not trusting you to be able to handle conflict appropriately. The smallest thing warrants a hissy fit on the best days. Heaven forbid it's anything actually bad, because in that case you throw shit and break stuff and yell. You're a fucking liability. How do you not see that there's a problem?


Your attitude is so shitty you made a girl cry at work today. You're so fucking unpleasant that I spent my weekend placating you when I should have been recovering from a horrific fucking week. I spent more time crying about you treating me like shit when I tried to help and be present to the best of my ability given the circumstances, than I did over the loss of a woman who helped raise me. Not because I wasn't mourning my loss, but because you were genuinely that fucking awful to me. 


You said most of your relationships bottleneck at 9 months and I'm starting to see why. Take a step back and find the common denominator here. Other people see it and have called you on it. I'm not crazy, I'm not imagining it. Think of the jobs and friends and relationships that have ended because you won't fucking bother to learn how to communicate and regulate your emotions. You choose instead to be miserable, and when you're miserable everyone around you is too, including me. You spin it as if you're a victim, but YOU are the common denominator. There's an addage I'm reminded of— if someone you met is an asshole, you met an asshole; if everyone you meet is an asshole, you're the asshole. 


I would be more inclined to take more responsibility in all of this, but I'm not going to gaslight myself like that. I've been in relationships spanning from two years to nearly a decade, and in all of them combined I've never fought or bickered as much as I have in my time with you. I've never had so many problems or so much shit blow up as I do with you. It's constant.  I'm always on eggshells wondering what little thing is going to set you off next. I don't even recognize myself anymore and I don't like what you've turned me into. And again, other people see how pissy you get and whisper about it, so I know objectively that I'm not the one with the fucked up attitude. I'm not misconstruing or misunderstanding you or your words, you just can't communicate worth a shit. I've been able to keep people in my life for decades, have you? I've made relationships thrive and flourish, have you? 


You can blame your childhood and mother all day, but you've been an adult for nearly a decade and a half. That's half a lifetime to do something about it. To own up, take accountability, and to make even the tiniest bit of progress. But I guess it would be wrong of me to expect you to put in any actual effort.


I honestly do not know if I can forgive what happened this weekend. We are just making each other miserable and I don't know that we can move past this. You're not willing to earnestly put in any real work, you've made that very clear. So what is my motivation to stay? What am I getting out of this? The honor of being your cum receptacle when you decide you actually want me around? But oh yeah there's always a problem with that too, because I want to be treated like a person you care about and not an inanimate object you toss aside when you're done getting yours. 


I put in time and effort and heart and I just get shit on for it and I think I'm probably done. On any given month we have maybe one week collectively that doesn't fucking suck and it's just not enough. I'm so bitter about how badly you misrepresented yourself. You love bombed the fuck out of me and when I was disappointed that the affection was dying, it was somehow my fault. When I call out disrespect, I'm the problem. When anything at all is going wrong, somehow I'm the cause.

Hey! A little information about myself to set the ground: 


I'm male, early 20s currently studying in medical school. I've always been an extremely shy and introverted person, struggled not just to make friends but even converse/open my mouth around strangers. I've got a few genuine friends and only a couple of them whom I *think* I can count on, but never had a female friend. 



(I'm going to keep this short, to the point and not explain the full events how it all transpired but if you feel some events are imp and I need to elaborate them further, ask me I'll do it.) 



So it all occurred over a span of 5 days. 3 practical exams on 3 days, 3 meetings of us. 


Day 1:


We first met accidentally in our practical exams as we had same case alloted. We were basically strangers before that. 


But as it progressed, she got comfortable quite quickly and I felt like there was some chemistry in between. She kept standing surprisingly close to me given our no prior interactions, kept making eye-contacts w/o any awkwardness. At one point, she literally pulled my arm to drag me over to look at something. I mean, which girl does that on 1st meeting? 



Day 3:



Second meeting. Different practical. Two groups were formed and luckily, we're on the same. At first, we're both hesitant to talk. But on the way, she kept maintaining proximity as if she was waiting for me to break ""the barrier"" and start convo. 



So I did and it went pretty smooth afterwards. We talked at several instances throughout the day, few laughs here and there. Again, with same energy, close proximity and no awkwardness in eye-contact. 




Day 5: 



Third meeting. Another practical. I was a little late in the room and everybody were set. After we both exchanged a few glances, there was a definite huge smiling exchange, sort of a greeting. 



This time, we talked and met on a ton of occasions. They were all study-related (just like the previous 2 meetings) and about professor viva, tips and stuff. All too generic and non-specific.



However, this day was little different and of self-realization. There were other students nearby as well ofc and I got to see her interact with them (A major difference being she probably knew the others for a long period but not me). It was not so much different than mine and then, it struck to me that it's her raw personality that she behaves like that. She is probably a full-spoken, extrovert. 




It all started hitting me then. I had fantasized everything about her (except the dirty part). I got attached to this girl in no time, dreamt on and on, made fake scenarios in my mind. It also affected my personal life by a tiny bit. I couldn't stop thinking about her, I wanted to stay near her.




For almost a year and a half, I hadn't interacted with anybody, felt lonely *but* comfortable in my own company. Didn't even talk with my friends, only to my mother to check with her daily. 



And then, this girl comes in my life out of nowhere, only to arise such deep emotional feelings. But she *did* make me feel good about myself, she made me try hard in my life, to *want* things. She awakened my sleeping self, I got to use parts of my brain that were shut off for years now. My mind did overtime and I felt like I was getting out of hibernation. I finally wanted to *live* the best of my life.




But there is a catch. I'm afraid she doesn't feel the same and wouldn't reciprocate. It's likely one of those times when a guy misinterprets a girl's kindness (chirpy, zealous, cheerful and joyous being in her case) for her interest. Especially with me, I mistook it because I never shared intimacy with *any* girl. 



And now I feel embarassed, ashamed and a little stupid. Still, I think about it a lot about my future moves but I can't wrap my head around it. I am clueless as how to proceed. And I just wanted to get it all out coz I can't let it eat me from inside anymore.



P.S. Thanks for reading if you made it this far, any suggestions or advices are always welcome. And I hope everybody is doing fine and I wish them nothing but goodwill and my blessings!

Hello everyone,  
          I am a 23 year old woman from India . I have been in a relationship for about 1 year now .

          About my past : My childhood was not so great . My dad is abusive and my mom just complies to his actions and I am a single child , so no one to rely on for support . So love and care as a kid was just not available for me . I grew up being silent and awkward , hated public situations , and never trusted anyone including myself . I used to be alone most of the time and I am still the same . But I didn't want it to be like that , I wanted to be with someone who would love me for what I am and who I am and not for how i look and for grades I get in my exams . 

          Fast forward in 2021 I met this guy online . We started talking over calls and texting over whatsapp . This continued for 3 years . In 2024 he proposed me .
I was overjoyed,  I couldn't believe that,  and ofcourse I said yes .  

Now the problem is , I am not sure if he actually loves me or I am just being used . Somedays I feel loved and cared for but soon I feel like this will only last for a few hours and it happens to be true . There are many times when he made me feel like shit and he never even felt bad for doing that to me . 

I asked him many times why does he love me and his answer would be silence or he just starts humming songs or he literally just changes the topic . I was surprised that he could even give me one reason for loving me . He criticizes me for feeling low and he called me a fool for feeling suicidal ( I have been suffering from Depression and anxiety from past 2 years ) .Anything that i do or say is wrong and sometimes i feel like he makes fun of me . Recently I sent him a funny meme and he said "" not funny , next time please send any such things in view once "" . Then once , I confronted him saying I don't feel like you love me , but he said "" that's your thought . If you want to be with me , just be ; otherwise it's your wish"" .
 
He recently lost his mother in the month of March and that has fuelled his arrogance . I am with him just because I don't want to hurt him . But I can't bear this emotional turmoil.  He treats me like shit sometimes and doesn't even apologise . I don't think dismissing somebody's emotions and calling them a fool for feeling the way they feel is justified . 

I have always longed for someone to genuinely love and care for me . I have never been so fortunate to experience this and he has obliterated my trust in love . Now I feel like I will never ever feel loved . Even if I get married , my husband is gonna be like my dad and it would be just me dragging through life . I have never seen a couple being genuinely in love in reality all my life . 

I know it's my fault to keep holding on to this relationship but I am not sure how to end it . I am always confused if he loves me or am I just being used for pleasure . I want to leave him without hurting him because I don't want problems in my life anymore . But I am not sure how to do it .

I just lopened up to my girlfriend (I'm 28M, she's 24F) about what’s been going on. I told her I’ve been having suicidal thoughts and that I struggle with anxiety and depression every day. I never opened up to her before because I felt like men shouldn’t do that—like I was supposed to suffer in silence.  

Recently, I almost acted on those thoughts (two nights ago), but I decided not to and chose to keep fighting. Today, I spoke with my HR representative and broke down crying for the first time in four years—since my mom passed. My HR and I agreed it would be best for me to take some time off and return after starting therapy and medication.  

I opened up to my girlfriend, and she was surprised. She told me I should have shared this with her sooner. Later, after work, she came over and seemed upset. I had gotten McDonald’s for dinner, forgetting we had plans to order in. For context, today is my birthday (technically yesterday), and she had planned to celebrate with me. But with everything going on, I completely forgot.  

While she was here, I could tell she was sad about something. I tried to make conversation, but she wasn’t really engaging. When I asked what was wrong, she said she’d had a bad morning—her mom made her pancakes with an extra scoop of protein powder (she’s on a strict diet and counts calories obsessively), which meant she had to adjust her dinner ""cheat meal."" On top of that, the pancakes were slightly burned.  

I told her, *“No offense, but I’m dealing with a lot right now,”* and was about to explain further. But after dating her for over three years, I’ve learned that once her day is ""ruined,"" she shuts down and doesn’t want to talk about anything.  

I don’t know what to do. I love her, but I’m struggling.

It still haunts me 6 years later,"He deleted the post with my photo because it got fewer comments. It still haunts me 6 years later Dear stranger,

There’s this one moment in my life that changed everything for me. It's been 6 years, but it still affects how I show up in friendships, how I see myself, and how I use social media. It might sound small to others, but it never felt small to me.

I had this friend — let’s call him David. We were very close. He used to post pictures of himself on Instagram, and his posts would get around 50 comments. I really admired him — not just because of the attention he got online, but because he was confident, good-looking, and “cool.” I always felt like the “uncool” one around him.

Back then, I used to post about him a lot — stories, pictures, tagging him — and he would often ask me to post things about him too, especially when he felt too awkward to post again and again himself. Because we had many mutual friends, posting through me helped him feel seen. I did it happily, out of blind friendship and affection.

One day, I asked him to post a picture of us together. I wasn’t trying to “get even” or anything — I just wanted to feel like I mattered to him as much as he mattered to me. I even insisted a bit, saying “If I’m your best friend, post it.”

He did post it.

But later… he deleted it.

No explanation. No conversation.

I later found out it was because the post didn’t get as many comments — just around 20. He deleted the post because it “underperformed,” and somehow, I felt like I was the reason for that. Like my face, my presence, brought his image down. And that one action crushed me.

I’ve never fully recovered from it.

It made me feel like I wasn’t good enough to be seen with someone publicly. Like I was someone people want to keep hidden. Like I was a burden to their image.

That might sound dramatic — but I’m just trying to explain how it felt. After that, I stopped wanting to go out with friends, or be seen in public places, or even be in group pictures. I didn’t want others to feel like they’re “lowering their worth” by being associated with me.

It also changed how I use social media.

Even now, I can’t post anything freely. I overthink everything — who will find it cringe, who will comment, what if no one responds? I get so anxious. And at the same time, I’m desperate for someone to tag me or post about me. Whenever that happens, I feel like I’ve been crowned. Like I’m finally “worth something.” I know it’s not healthy, but that’s how my brain works now.

I feel like I’ve tied my entire self-worth to this silly, digital validation. Even though my mind knows this is “just Instagram,” my heart feels like that is real life. And if people don’t show that I matter publicly, then maybe I really don’t.

What hurts most is that David never even had a conversation with me about it. He didn’t explain or express anything. If he had said he wanted to maintain his aesthetics or that it made him uncomfortable, at least I could’ve tried to understand. But silence? That just made me feel like I didn’t even deserve an explanation.

I’ve internalized this for years. It affected my studies. My confidence. My relationships — even with my cousins and my parents. I’ve even had suicidal thoughts because of how worthless it made me feel. That’s how deep it went.

I know some people reading this might think, “Oh come on, it’s just a deleted post, people have real problems.” But for me, this is real. This one moment shaped the way I relate to the world.

I’m not asking for sympathy. I just want someone to say,
“Yeah… that sounds really hard. And you didn’t deserve to feel this way.”

I don’t want people to scold David. He was probably immature back then. I was immature too. I’m not angry at him now. I’ve just been carrying this wound quietly, and today I wanted to let it out.

Thank you for reading.

Please don’t send hate or judgement towards “David.” I’m not angry at him anymore. I was just immature, and maybe he was too. I’ve carried this for too long, and I’m trying to heal. I don’t need advice or solutions, unless you genuinely want to share something kind. All I really want is to be told, “Yeah… that sounds really hard. And you didn’t deserve to feel that way.”",Positive,High-Risk,n’t,"(37.9456724, 23.7139908)",37.9456724,23.7139908

Sometimes I'm so sad and devastated and get so depressed i can barely function, other times I feel neutral, other times I feel kind of... angry at them for not listening to me and ""glad"" it's over. I complain in therapy and to my friends so much but it doesn't help much. I wish I could talk to my ex one more time, at least. They blocked me when we got in an argument and told me not to contact them again so I'm trying to respect that but god it's hard.

I'm posting this even tho they know my reddit and our last argument was started cuz they didn't like me posting about my feelings before... I didnt say anything about them as a person so I didnt get what upset them so much. Just whatever I was feeling even if it was irrational. Kinda hope they're stalking me and see how much I miss them. I wish i could message them. I still love them and I know i need to get over them but i just can't. Even when i get angry thinking about things they said and did that I felt wronged by, I just can't let go of the lingering feelings. I love so intensely it kills me. They threw it all away but it took several days for me to decide to delete their pictures... and I still haven't deleted the drawings they drew that I saved.

I feel like I'm hopeless, a lost cause. My friends keep saying i deserve better and I need to move on but i can't. I honest to god thought I was gonna marry this person. I mean, upon reflection the breakup was inevitable, and staying with them without fights would mean neglecting my feelings, but... Idk. I guess it's like my friends say, i got addicted to love. I do miss them as a person though! I miss their silliness, I miss drawing with them, I miss seeing their art, learning about all the things that make them *them*. I hope they message me again, and wanna be friends again or something. I treasured them so much even before we dated or my feelings became romantic.

I've lost sleep over this... Lately I've had to listen to something as I fall asleep because otherwise my thoughts would race and itd all be them. When i said i had a mind virus of them I meant it

If you're reading this, I really do miss you. I won't start a fight if you message me, I promise. Maybe we can't date, but... I still wanna talk to you and spend time with you.

More specifically, animations, comics and digital drawings. I remember asking my mom for sketchbooks all the time and all of them I would fill them with drawings and sketches. I even got an iPad with an Apple Pencil for Christmas when I was 12, which I loved and to this day I still have it with me.

I would spend every single day drawing more and more, making more and more drawings of different things, animals, people, plants, views. Anything I could do. I had lots of ideas for major projects and stories I wanted to tell. I’ve built so many stories and lores I genuinely can’t count them, all of them with their own characters, stories, plots, even values I wanted to transmit through them.

None of that matters anymore, it never did. I never became better at drawing. No matter how much I tried, how many tutorials I watched, how many hours a day I spent drawing and practicing. There was a total zero progress in the course of years. When I say zero, I mean zero. No matter how much I tried, I never became better, not even a little bit, nothing. I’ll never become better.

Drawing or even thinking about drawing only makes me depressed now, even grabbing a pencil with the intention or drawing something is painful. My life is genuinely empty without drawing and seeing so many people of my age being 100 times better than I’ll ever be at drawing/animating makes me feel void in the inside. It came to a point I genuinely feel no intention of living anymore if I can’t draw. All the stories I wanted to tell are gone, they’ll never be shared, because my life wasn’t meant for the ONLY thing I wanted to be.

December last year, my partner and I were on top of the world. We just had a check-up confirming my pregnancy, and, while this little baby was not 100% planned, we happily started planning the next few months and years of our lives together. We were going to buy a house - a house we had fallen in love a few weeks ago already - and have a wedding in the nice yard we had out in the back. I was going to take a break from work as I had some medical issues, and take a break from my post-graduate studies to focus on the new baby. He had a great job with great benefits and we had the financial stuff down to a T.

A couple of months later, on the same damn day we closed on the house, my partner got furloughed due to some political decisions which I'm sure most of us are aware of by now. 

At first, we were both so hopeful. *You'll surely get a job soon,* we'll say, reassuring each other. *It was the right decision to get the house, at least the three of us will have a roof over our head.* However, as time goes on, we are slowly feeling the stress and the burn out, and the lingering question of, ""have we done the right thing bringing a baby into this world with all this financial stress?"" 

My partner, bless his heart, will not allow me to feel stressed over the situation. He started driving for a ride-sharing app and delivering food to help us get by, and while the pay is far from what he was earning before, we are definitely, thankfully, not going hungry. This is a man who has been working his ass off the last couple of months to be able to scrape up some money for the mortgage, watching as our savings slowly dwindle. He will never let me feel the stress and the anxiety he feels, but I can see it in his face every time he checks his email for feedback from one of the many companies he's applied to... 2 months of sending applications for nothing. 

Meanwhile, here I am, feeling so bad about the situation and the timing that he will never know that I'm battling through some stress and depression of my own, too. I feel so guilty that I'm unable to work, and I feel so bad knowing he's gone from leading an international team to getting people their pizza or groceries. I feel so guilty every time he tells me to get something I'm craving for in the grocery, knowing that having some 'wants' in our grocery list can set us back a couple of bucks. I feel so bad asking him to pick up free baby furniture that people are giving away on social media because I know he would have loved to shop for those with me. Lastly, I feel bad for thinking that I shouldn't have continued with this pregnancy because we truly couldn't have had the worst timing in the world. 

I'm sitting next to him right now while he looks for more jobs to apply to. I love this man so much; he's given so much of himself to me and to our baby and I appreciate all that he has done for us thus far. But god I am so tired of the stress and the anxiety. I'm not sure how much longer I can hold on while still appearing strong for me, him, and our baby who's due in June. 

I have so many things to say about this whole political thing that got us into this mess, but that's for another day. Right now, I'm just praying for a miracle - praying that all of this sacrifice will be for something meaningful.",Positive,Low Concern,living the dream,"(47.04416502814285, -123.19423428685717)",47.04416502814285,-123.19423428685717

I used to be confident and full of potential, but now I feel like a failure. I’m sharing this to release the shame and begin healing.

Alright, so I decided to let this out to release some really deep-rooted shame.

I’m a 25-year-old guy, currently unemployed, and I’ve been out of school for 3 years. I’ve always been bright, self-aware, and deeply ambitious. I was the black sheep of the family—demanding respect, especially as the youngest—but my needs were never really understood or met.

A few years ago, I was on a high. I had a close friend, and together we got into personal development and stock investing. Around the same time, I also got into a relationship with a girl who had just left an abusive relationship. I supported her through that.

I’ve been bullied and dismissed for most of my life, so when these two people came into my world, I thought maybe I had finally “done the work” to earn love and a better life. My self-esteem was sky-high. I believed I could do anything.

Then in 2021, my best friend called me and said I wasn’t there for him. That he felt I abandoned him when he needed me. I was shocked. I thought I had been honest and caring. I had tried to get him to see how his choices were hurting him, but in the end, he cut me off. That broke me. It made me question my entire sense of worth. If being a “good friend” still ended like this, then maybe I wasn’t one. And because our friendship was tied to personal development and investing, I became repulsed by all of it. I shut down.

It didn’t help that a year earlier, in 2020, my girlfriend had opened up to me and revealed she had been gang raped in high school. I had never been exposed to evil like that, and I didn’t know how to handle it. I had panic attacks, spiraled into porn and weed (healed both addictions now), and even thought about ending my life—but I couldn’t, because I didn’t want to hurt her. I didn’t want to be in the relationship, but I believed I’d be a terrible person if I left. So I stayed, trying to “fix” her. Trying to save her.

Eventually, in early 2024, I decided I had to change. I broke up with her. I got extremely fit through boxing. I started focusing on healing and building back my life. But even now, I feel like it’s all worthless. There’s this deep shame and self-hate that keeps whispering, “you’re a failure.”

Shame tells me “you don’t have a respectable professional job, what a bum, ur mom and dad were right”. 

Even though I know im attractive and genuinely caring, my shame tells me “you can’t talk to any girls. You’re broken, and you lack ambition. The girls that you want don’t want a 25 year old child” 

Even trying to find a job “you’re invisible. People look at ur resume and think I can see how much of a loser you are” 

So the truth is, I’m lost in my mid 20s. I guess I’m free eh. I no longer need to burden myself to achieve a certain expectation. I no longer feel the need to achieve someone else’s level of success. I’m just a 25 year old who’s a bit lost, broke, and still a lot to be grateful for. 

I’d like to think I’m posting here for support. I always loved the world and its people, I knew people were kinder than my family. Now I feel like I failed everyone and I’m letting it out because shame needs secrecy to survive. I no longer want to protect it. If anyone has gone through deep shame in their life, please share what you did to get out of it. I’d definitely appreciate it.",Positive,Low Concern,,"(None, None)",,

Last night, I went to my school’s graduation prom. I thought everything was going to be normal — I talked with my friends, ate, took pictures, and us 4 friends danced together, which did felt really fun. But that was until I felt strange emotions. It was unexplainable at first, but I came to recognize it eventually. I felt like an idiot, and even more when I sat back down to our table and watched everyone do their thing. I came primarily for sentimental value, but I felt lonely. I felt too selfish for feeling this way, because I have friends anyway, so why would I? But it just seemed so awful and different. The blasting music and the color-changing and flickering lights were nerve-wracking, the aircon’s too cold and my palms felt sweaty, everybody looked different and I felt left alone, I felt insecure and intimidated in too many ways, that I felt lethargic and couldn’t help but cry. Everything felt too overwhelming, so I went to the bathroom to try to calm myself down, but I cried instead. My friends noticed that I was down, but I couldn’t tell them why, because it felt too stupid to cry over something like that, and ranting about this thing feels even more stupid. But even today, I feel weird. I feel sad and lonely. And I don’t know how I’m going to get rid of it.

I (21F) just got notified that I’m terminated from my position as a restaurant server. I got that job 3 weeks ago when I was hypomanic (I was recently diagnosed with bipolar II). I think the stress of a new workplace, combined with the sudden workload of 45 hours a week, heightened my hypomania.

My family situation has always been rough, but these past few months have been the hardest of my life. My other diagnoses are anxiety, depression, and PTSD. I’m currently on academic leave from college because I got so depressed I failed 2 classes.

I overcompensated for my social anxiety at work by being extremely friendly. My boss called me “bubbly,” which is very unlike me. I was bouncing off the walls, easily distracted, and made preventable mistakes. I also made some jokes that my boss didn’t take kindly to (not offensive jokes, just silly and inappropriate for the workplace). I think he started to actively dislike me. It’s so embarrassing because I know I’m usually a professional, capable employee with a strong work ethic.

My biggest reason for termination was that I called out of 5 shifts during my first 3 weeks. In my first week, I found the job extremely easy and did high-intensity workouts at the gym after every shift. On my second week, I crashed and swung into severe depression. I called out of work 4 days in a row. Week 3 went smoothly and I worked all my shifts.

Today is the first day of Week 4, and I woke up extremely depressed and with the heaviest menstrual cramps/bleeding I’ve ever had in my life. Despite knowing I was on thin ice, I called out of work again. Then I got fired.

What’s most embarrassing is that I’ll tell my parents I’m going to work, call out of my shift, and spend the whole day drifting between cafes and playing Stardew Valley. It’s the only thing that calms me, and I’m blowing money at cafes just because I don’t want to be home. I feel like a loser, I have no tolerance for any kind of work. My friends are graduating college next month while I’m a complete mess. 

Ultimately, I’m a bit relieved because I didn’t sink too much time into this workplace, and now I can take the lessons I’ve learned and get a fresh start somewhere new. My biggest takeaways are to be more professional and composed in my workplace, and not overshare.",Negative,Low Concern,my position as,"(36.20067361891589, -115.17210531538883)",36.20067361891589,-115.17210531538883

Aromantic = A romantic orientation that includes people with no romantic feelings (or little romantic feelings, in some definitions). 

So, I’ve been aromantic ever since I can remember. I just could never understand. What do you mean you have a crush on someone? What do you mean you want to date and marry someone? 

I don’t understand. How is it any different than just seeing someone as a friend? Why can’t you just marry a friend and go live with them? 

So, no matter how much I try, I can never make sense of it! I can never see the appeal. And because of that, I will have to die alone. After my mother is gone, I will have no one. I will watch my family die and then have no one else to rely on. I honestly can’t imagine living through this. Ever now and then I start thinking I’ll eventually have to end my own life even though I don’t want to


I’m so scared. I’m living alone for college and it’s awful. It can get so lonely it almost physically hurts. I got sick this weekend and I could barely take care of myself. What will happen when I grow old? I’ll most likely die at home and then be found several days later. 

But other than that, how will I ever buy a house?? I’ll never be able to even split the bills. 

It feels like a curse. When I was younger, I used to think about pretending to have feelings for someone just so I didn’t have to be alone. But I can’t do this. I can’t pretend to understand because I don’t. It feels so, so disgusting. Maybe I’m just too autistic to get it. 

Please, I need someone to tell me. Am I overreacting?? Maybe it isn’t that bad, and I’m just obsessing over this.

I realize now it wasn't her dream, she loved me and wanted to do everything with me, even if it meant leaving her family and our friends behind. I think those things made her resent me to a degree, she felt like she needed to do them to keep me happy. This is where I messed up, I wanted us to room together and she thought it'd be a bad idea because we had argued over pointless shit before. Her aunt lived about 30 mins away in a nearby city (a place for us to cool off) so I convinced her to sign up to room together in non-binary housing. I ended up getting a call from the school that she  didn't want to room with me anymore and she wasn't answering my calls. Finally when she did, I hadn't calmed down and was furious with her. We ended up taking some time to ourselves for a few days to cool off, like usual, and I apologized for being such a dick. If I remember correctly, the ""worst part about it"", as I told her, was that she had ""lied"" about it. Looking back, she was probably scared how I'd react if she didn't agree with me because I had been reassuring her the past year it'd work out and I proved her right in that moment of anger. I should have been happy she finally had the courage to put her foot down, I should've been happy if I felt betrayed. 

She had a habit of canceling plans before then and I had a habit of freaking out, my friends always told me I was justified (we saw each other maybe 4-5 times over the summer despite living <10 miles away from one another because something would always come up last minute). She told me in our last talk that this was because she felt like we'd fight or be cold towards each other whenever we'd spend a night together (think avoidant attachment)

We broke up when she told me she was staying at her aunt's but really went to a party that I was invited to but had declined because she had promised to come over that night for new years eve, like we did every year. After my friends told me she went to the party, I asked her why she ""lied"" about where she was going and she answered that I always listen to my friends and hangout with them but she feels like she never sees her so the party was a chance to do so. We did the usual push and pull for a couple weeks, and I freaked out again when she didn't come to my birthday but came to meet me to borrow 30$ for lunch with her friends. I told her I felt left out and an argument insured which culminated in ""I don't know if I see you or love you the same, anymore"" she said ""I can't keep doing this, I don't love you the same either"" 

I have a lot of friends in my home town, but because my entire college friend group was based around her, I lost everyone here when we split and haven't had very many interactions outside of class other than thanking people for holding the door and such.

I've been talking to my friends a bit on the phone while mourning her but this weekend I went home to hangout with my friends and my friend told me show posted her new boyfriend on her story and they were dressed for his prom and I'm broken all over again. I'm self aware enough now to realize that this is the textbook stages of grief and that I'm somewhere between bargaining and depression right now but I know she'd never listen to me. We blocked each other on everything after our last talk (setting boundaries and such) but I felt so wrong cutting her off, like there was more to do. We'd broken up before during times when we should've taken space but never to this level.

There is a lot I didn't include because it's too much to write down, but I can't help feeling like it's my fault entirely at every stage. I made her ""lie"" to me because I couldn't handle the truth and knew she hated being called a liar but I still called her out on every single one, even ones that didn't matter. In our most recent ""break up"" she'd beg me to talk to her about the problems we faced and to at least meet in person and I'd tell her I wasn't interested until I felt guilty and invited her over. She'd immediately shut down when we started talking, seeming very detached, but the second or third time we met to talk we'd sleep together and make up.

I miss her so much, I want to talk to her every day but I know she's happy with who she's with now and she told me she doesn't want to communicate anymore. I know I'm selfish, I know it's my fault, I know nothing good can come out of it but I just wanted to be happy with her.",Negative,Low Concern,,"(None, None)",,

But I have always felt extremely guilty for taking up so much of their time and resources. 

When i was in high school, my mom told me that when i was born, the doctor cut her open even though she told them not to. I have always felt extremely guilty. She says she doesnt care, but i feel awful that she had someone blatantly disregard her lack of consent. It was not a life threatening situation. Ever since then, ive felt extremely guilty for my birth because my birth caused that to happen. 

My Dad also went through a mental health crisis when i was in middle school. I also went through a crisis at the same time. I feel like me going through that crisis at the same time only made it harder.

When i left for college, my mom was extremely lonely. I came to realize she didnt really have a hobby outside of parenting. In fact, when i was young, she pretty much dedicated ALL of her time to parenting. 

I just feel awful knowing someone spent all of their youth raising me when I'm extremely depressed and completely unmotivated to do anything. I think my parents should have abandoned me because they would have actually been able to live their lives. I would not have been any better off, but I also dont think that matters much because ive been mentally ill my whole life and I wouldn't have been happy either way. I try to do the best that i can to get better, but it doesnt make me happy. If i cant be happy, i wish my parents at least could. My parents wasted the best years of their life on me and I don't feel anything but emptiness most of the time. I work out, try to talk to people, get healthy, ect. because I want to be happy for them, but it hasnt worked and I feel bad for taking up someone's life for nothing.

I’ve been on lots of dates since my last relationship, I took a break from it a while back because I realised I wasn’t ready, now I am back into it a little and I’ve met 2 people since I started dating again

One of them, we went on 5 dates, and the other one, I just had my second date today. Ended it with both of them today and yesterday, I don’t know why but at the beginning of getting to know them I feel fine, I’m interested and feeling open and excited 

And then suddenly I feel socially cold, like my body feels tense and I feel like I have a wall up. I just don’t feel relaxed, on the dates the guys both were touching my back as we walked along or if we sat next to each other, but it just made me feel like I wanted to shrivel up away from them, I got kissed by my date today and if I didn’t have my seatbelt on I think I would have just rolled out of the car seat

With both of the separate guys as we walked around I felt so anxious to be seen walking with them. I don’t know why, they were perfectly fine and I even found them attractive. 

I feel so frigid about physical touch, something that has previously come really natural for me… I can’t tell if I’m putting a wall up to sabotage myself or I’m just not interested in these specific people, even though to start with, I did feel like that…. Just feeling like it’s been a bit of a flop right now. 

I am totally fine by myself, I’m not desperate to get into a relationship, I don’t feel lonely, but it would be so fun to have a boyfriend again where we can do my hobbies together and do fun things again, someone that really cares about me and makes me happy. I don’t want to get frustrated with dating again but it feels like it’s because of something inside me that it keeps going wrong… I’m finding it so hard to open up and build a connection with someone….

I feel hopeless.,"I hate my life and my decision. I feel hopeless. Well, I'll let it all out here. I'm only a 15 year old male but I've already ruined my life in so many ways. 

I've been addicted to porn for 4 years(since 11 years old). I've been trying to quit for as long as I remember and I rarely even go 5 days without it. It's gotten to a point where I don't even watch normal stuff anymore. I watch extremely messed up stuff and I HATE myself for what I watch and desire.

Secondly, I've got a food disorder called ARFID(Avoidant Restrictive Food Intake Disorder). I'm pretty sure you guys don't know what that is so I'll tell you shortly. Basically I have a few safe foods which I can eat fine without and issues. But most other food I just have an irrational fear. So for example I don't eat ANY fruits other than bananas. I barely eat any vegetables. This has truly affected me in more ways that can be said. I don't have a huge issue in my health but if I continue like this there's no doubt I'll have a health problem in the future. What is affecting me right now is the social aspect of it. Most social outings include eating food with people. People just think I'm this extremely spoiled picky eater because I never ever talk about my ARFID, so they wouldn't know. But I'm pretty sure since this is soooo rare, that if I tell people, it'll make it worse and they'll be judgmental. I just feel like an alien around people from this. You might even think I'm making this up from how illogical it is. Like, just try the new food. Yeah I can't. Even my own family doesn't get it. They sometimes talk literally Infront of me about how tiering I am with food. And they compare me with other normal kids. So I literally have NO ONE to talk to about this. Not even my family.

Thirdly, I have had so many issues with ingrown toenails before and I did surgery before because it was severely ingrown and infected. Surgery recovery traumatized me sooo much. Anyways after the surgery for some reason my nails fell off and the new ones grew ingrown and are now infected again. It hurts to even walk normally now. I used to play and enjoy tennis and football but now I can't even do that. My only solution is another surgery and I genuinely am not looking forward to it and I definitely won't do it now cause I have exams and surgery recovery lead me to stay in bed unable to move for like a week. 

Fourthly, I lack the ability to talk to people outside of the small talk phase. I can hardly make friends, I just don't know what to do or say. This could stem from my porn addiction but I don't know. 

Fifthly, I don't know if this is the right sub for this but I'll just say it, you can just ignore it if you aren't christian. I feel like I really just got distant from god and I feel like my faith has really weakened. I don't understand how to keep him the main thing in my life. I can't read the Bible consistently everyday and I just find it difficult to have a relationship with him.

So that's almost all. But I genuinely have gotten to a point of hopelessness where I just know I won't change. I won't quit porn. I won't beat this stupid ARFID. I won't ever know how to make new friends and have real relationships. I know this isn't the correct mindset if I want to change. But it's the mindset that I've developed from years of trying and failing. I tried to change soooooooooooo many times. But no matter what I try I just don't end up changing. I'm just sick and tired of my life and my decisions and everything related to me. I know I won't do it, but I've just had some suicidal thoughts recently because I truly can't find another way out. I know I have potential, I know if I quit my porn addiction and beat my ARFID, my life would significantly improve. But I just can't do it, I tried and failed. I also don't have the courage to talk to ANYONE about this topic. I even made a new account for this. I don't know who will even read this far but thank you for whoever does.

I’m at the end of my rope—I can’t take it anymore. It’s been four years now that I’ve been struggling with some very strange symptoms that I can’t get rid of.

Four years ago, after what was supposedly a panic attack, I ended up in the hospital where, from what I understood at the time, I was given half a Xanax and sent home. That was the last day I felt like a normal person.

The next day I woke up with a pressure in the frontal part of my brain, as if it were frozen, and vision problems: I have very good eyesight, but my eyes can’t focus on a single object—in a microscopic sense, my vision constantly shifts left and right and I can’t focus on anything. Reading, writing… everything is difficult. Everything around me felt strange. I lost the sense of spatial perception, as if everything behind me no longer existed for my brain, and the same with other rooms in the house—whatever I didn’t see or whatever room I wasn’t in, simply ceased to exist.

These symptoms have eased a bit, but they’ve never completely gone away.
About six months before this happened, I had a strong panic attack because of weed. One night I smoked some weed (the second time in my life) and drank a lot of alcohol. When I got upstairs to my room, I started feeling really bad—my heart was racing and I panicked. Eventually, I calmed down and, with my heart still pounding, I laid down and fell asleep. The next day, I was completely fine, like nothing had ever happened.

Compared to what I’m experiencing now, that weed moment made the world feel more alive and vibrant, so I don’t know if it had anything to do with my current condition.
Back to now—I’ve taken psychiatric medication for two and a half years. It helped a little with my mood, but not at all with the symptoms.

Recently, about two months ago, while looking through various forums, I came across MTHFR, which is said to potentially contribute to symptoms like mine by reducing the production of folic acid and B12, which might impact my symptoms. I started taking B12 and B9 supplements, and right away I felt some improvement. The frontal pressure almost completely disappeared, and my short-term memory is now better. My gastric issues have also improved a bit.
But what I can’t seem to get rid of is the blurry vision and the feeling of spatial disconnection.

I’m fully aware of myself—since the very first moment this started—but I can’t escape this. It’s like I’m trapped in a bubble. It’s not depersonalization or derealization… or whatever it is—I just want it to stop so I can enjoy life again.

I’m tired of this, and I’ve even had suicidal thoughts, but I don’t think I have the courage to go through with it.

I just want to be normal again. Please help me… I feel like I can’t take it anymore. I just want to be a human being again.",Positive,High-Risk,,"(None, None)",,

I just keep on pushing these feelings away and trying to stay positive, but with each month that passes, it becomes more obvious to me. I keep on setting myself up for failure, even though I should know better and I am tired of being stuck in this place. 

I don’t even want anything special, I just want to be like every other girl my age. Have a friend group (or maybe just one real friend to start with), date, go to concerts, go outside, party and all that stuff, but I just can’t do these things and I don’t know why. When I went to high school I tried to be different so I’d find friends- didn’t work. Then I started working and hoped that I’d find friends- didn’t work and the job put me in a really bad place (kindergarten assistant teacher). Then I started college and once again I had the big hope of finding friends and living that college life, maybe even moving out, but again I failed miserably. 

It’s been over a year since I started and I don’t have a friend group like the others have. I only have occasional acquaintances, but it’s all really superficial. I got adopted by a friend group, but they ignore me most times and when they don’t, I just sit next to them and we don’t really talk to each other. I never know what to say to them or anyone else and whatever these people talk or laugh about just doesn’t interest me. I don’t understand what’s wrong with me… I WANT what they have, why can’t I bring myself to try to do better? At the beginning of freshman year last year, there was a trip where all the freshmen could get to know each other, but I didn’t go, because the thought of being away from home really scared me, especially when there’s no one I know. But when I saw the videos of the trip online, I became jealous and regretted not going. However, anytime a similar situation comes up, I make the same decision, cause I know that that’s what I really want. But at the same time, I want to socialize, it seems that I only like the thought of it though. 

Next semester we have a mandatory internship for the entire semester. Now, I study social work, a decision which now I start to realize was an idea just as bad as working in kindergarten and I’d love to work with mentally disabled (sorry, I don’t know if that’s the appropriate term) children. But today I had the interview (which caused a sleepless night and extreme morning sickness) and the minute I stepped into that school, all the screaming started to make me really uncomfortable and scared. I was in there for literally 20 minutes, but as soon as I got home, I felt like I had run a marathon. I thought it would be the right decision to do my internship there. Next to non-disabled children, I seem way too immature and they wouldn’t take me seriously, cause I do NOT talk, sound or act like a 19 year old, so I thought next to disabled children, I’d seem more mature and make a better impression. 
Now that I’ve actually been in that school, I realize how unfit I am for that internship or any other internship. I can barely think of any other places where it’s quieter and less crowded (news flash- as a social worker, you have to talk to people) and the long hours are frightening me. At the kindergarten, I worked 8 hours, which is regular, but it EXHAUSTED me. I was depressed, had no energy and saw my life passing by and I don’t want that to happen again. 

I just feel so insanely stupid and weird. My mom is on vacation for only one week and every time I think about her, I start bawling like a baby and want to be with her. I am 19 years old, people are living across the country or even the world at my age, why am I such a baby? 

It feels like my life is falling apart, I started becoming too tired to go to some classes, I keep on ditching my only friend (who knows nothing about me and always talks about herself, but I can’t blame her, cause I don’t say anything, so she does all the talking), but it’s always been like I dreaded hanging out with her or anyone else, as I’d much rather just stay in my room for some reason. 

I don’t know what to do about that internship. I wish I would’ve chosen something else for college, but the options where I live are very limited and that was basically the only thing possible. I already quit that kindergarten thing, I can’t quit college too… my parents, especially my father would be so disappointed. My older sibling is perfect in every way and also very successful. I can’t hurt them with having one perfect child and one total loser, but I just don’t know what’s wrong with me. I love the idea of social work and helping people, but I can’t do it. I wish I would’ve been somewhere else, where I could study cinema and become a filmmaker, but that’s just a stupid dream. The only thing that I like about college is that I only have one or two classes a day and then I can go home and rest. 

I wish I was different so bad. I’d rather be the most generic, boring girl to exist, if it meant that I had simple things like confidence and friends, but I have achieved NOTHING. I don’t even have my drivers license. 

I am so tired.

It wasn’t because there was no love left, but because I was going through a really dark time. My grandma had just died, I was on antidepressants that made my emotions worse, and honestly, I wasn’t myself. I hurt him, not because I wanted to, but because I was broken. I think his parents supported the breakup because they saw how much pain he was in, and I get that.

We see each other every single day at school. We’re in a lot of the same classes, and we’re going to be in sixth form together too, so I’ll be seeing him for the next two years. Since the breakup, I’ve been slowly healing. I’m not the same girl I was back then. I’ve grown so much and honestly, I’m thriving now. But he’s like a complete stranger to me these days, and it kills me. We used to be best friends, share inside jokes, laugh until we couldn’t breathe — now he just feels distant, even when we make small talk.

He blocked me on Instagram after we broke up, and I’ve respected that (i did beg and beg for weeks after he left though which i regret) . I want to ask him to unblock me, just so things feel a bit more neutral. Not because I want to stalk him, but because I don’t want to be this ghost in his digital life. But I’m scared it’ll just push him further away.

There’s a part of me that hopes, maybe one day, we could start over — not pick up where we left off, but really start again, from step one, with who we are now. But I’m not holding on to that anymore. I’m not chasing. I just wish he knew how much I’ve changed, and how much I wish I could go back and protect him from the version of me that was grieving so hard.

So I guess I’m just wondering — should I ever ask him to unblock me? Or just let time do its thing? Is it better to just vanish completely from his life and let him feel free from me, or keep being this kind and distant version of myself in the background? I don’t even know what I’m hoping for anymore — closure, a second chance, peace?

This is such a weird, bittersweet feeling to sit with.

I’ve genuinely grown so much since my breakup. I’ve healed from the darkest parts of it — the crying, the confusion, the constant pain. I’ve rebuilt my confidence, started putting myself first again, and even begun opening up to new people. I’m not stuck. I’m not waiting around. But…

If he ever came back — even just with a “hey, can we try again?” — I think I’d say yes.

Not because I’m desperate. Not because I haven’t healed. But because I know how strong our connection was before everything fell apart. And I wish, even just once, we could try again from a better place — without the grief, without the depression, without all the emotional chaos I was dealing with back then. I wish he’d known me at my best, not just at my lowest.

He seems happier now. More confident. Posting more. Laughing more. Just doing him. And I support that, truly and i’m so proud of him. But some days it’s hard not to wonder — does he remember those little moments like I do? The laughs, the inside jokes, the moments we shared, the excitement I used to feel just seeing his name pop up? Does any of that still matter to him at all?

Maybe it doesn’t. Maybe it’s just a “me” thing. But I don’t think it’s stupid to admit that I’d give it one more shot — not forever, not for some fairytale ending, just for peace of mind. Just so we could say we tried again when the timing was right. Or maybe we would get a fairytale ending? Who knows 🤷‍♀️

And if it didn’t work? At least I’d know. At least it wouldn’t be a lingering “what if.”",Positive,Low Concern,,"(None, None)",,

F25, F26.","I think I'm done with my relationship. F25, F26. We spent a week together after the worst march of our lives. We had an argument with an ex-friend after telling him to stop badmouthing another friend, he started badmouthing us to other people as well and my girlfriend's past friend group got involved, as well as her family, it was an entire thing and she didn't eat for days. I came over and took care of her in her depressive state. She's a bit better now, but still just coming out of it.

The thing is we have been fighting before all of this, and we paused it to take care of the current situation. It wasn't exactly a fight, but a series of very stern conversations about our future together. Ending the relationship was brought up. She didn't want to, but I have been dealing with emotional burnout and wanted out.

What started our contention was something so mundane I'm actually ashamed I got jealous of it. We used to go on walks with friends, and she and another friend got to talking. It was a very lively conversation, and she was so into it. I stopped listening what it was about, I was hurt and stayed quiet. We don't really have conversations. I talk about things, she nods, grunts, laughs politely. Curt responses always. I asked her to tell me one time she talked to me like an actual person, her partner, someone she's interested in. She couldn't answer. I asked if I'm just not that interesting to her, or if I'm doing something wrong. Nothing, she says I'm perfect. It's veen two years of this. From the start she's been so distant. I've always been secure im my relationships but how she treats me has made me so insecure over the years.

She's an avoidant attachment. She's always in a bad mood with me but so happy with her friends. I don't feel wanted in this relationship. I've already said its okay if she wasn't interested anymore, or falling out of love. She just needs to tell me so I can finally stop trying to chase her while she holds me at arms length. She keeps saying she'll change, and after every fight she does for a little while, and then she goes back to the same behaviors. I give her space, she wants to be closer. I close the gap, she basically runs from it.

I'm tired. All I want is warmth in my relationship. She keeps telling me that she loves me, and that she just needs time to warm up, but I've already waited for so long. How much longer do I need to get hurt? I need more than words. I feel like I keep living for the future in this relationship. I never feel like I'm enjoying the present, just staying for a potential that I'm not even sure would happen. I digress, she has gotten better with it. A little bit. She's warmer, more communicative, less distant. But it's not enough. Why is she so much happier with other people but refuse to let me go? I want to have conversations like that with her too. I've tried to leave so many times and it's always met with her begging not to. So many promises. So many plans. And she always breaks them. I'm just resentful now. I haven't felt like a partner in a long time. Just a roommate she kisses. I've given her everything she wants. I've been supportive, understanding, patient. I took care of her. When I ask, she never has any criticism towards me. We went through individual counseling, meds, talking and talking and talking. Nothing is working. I don't want to wake up old and still waiting for her to be better. She won't even hold my hand in public.

She's starting to be okay again, and I'm wondering if I could do it now. If I should do it. Is this still fixable? Should I just not add on to what she's going through now and wait a couple weeks or something? I don't know. I feel like I just really want out of this relationship. I just want to do it in the least painful way, not to mention a successful way as well because she keeps roping me back in. Then we're back in the same miserable routine. I love her so much.

This is a vent. I'm in my feels. I'm just tired of the bullshit.


I love / loved who my wife was.

She was the smartest, strongest, most beautiful source of peace in my life. She honestly was a source of joy in my life...

Over the past 3 years it's been a decline.

She rarely contributes to housework aside from some ""home improvements that she does"" (I help with all of them). While I still do the majority of the cooking, cleaning, errands, and care for the dogs.

She constantly brings me problems and complaints. She is a neurotic mess that rarely has a positive interaction with me.

I still take her on dates, spend time with her... I still fucking try. But it's getting harder to care.

She is the heaviest she has ever been in weight and quit shaving her fucking armpits and has  mini facial hair. Like... Fucking try. A MODICUM of effort. I still work out and diet.

She is content to just fuck off on her phone, binge watch anime, do whatever arts n crafts is her flavor and baby talk at our dogs. Fuck your goddamn anime. It's all the SAME PLOT. Can you watch ANYTHING else? Some variety? SOMETHING?

God forbid you touch me of your own volition! I used to throw myself at you and you'd reject me. We went to individual therapy for this and as soon as ""everything was better"" you went back to not trying.

I get it! You have depression and other mental disorders. I can empathize. But you can't at least FUCKING TRY? You basically just go to a psych for meds to either knock yourself out or sell. 

And the worst part? I STILL fucking love you! I tolerate your lack of effort, your pessimism, your literal victim mentality about EVERYTHING. 

You hate your job but refuse to even look at changing careers because of pay. You hate your body but don't exercise and eat like shit. You have mental health issues but it takes INTERVENTION LEVEL interaction from my family and I for you to even go to therapy.

I'm not even attracted to you at this point. I white knuckled it for a damn year and now barely have a reason to try. You'll just reject me or half assed reciprocate at best. You used to fucking try.

I know you basically take me for granted. I see it. If I decided to leave you'd be left in your ""terrible life"" that ISN'T THAT BAD! You have a good paying job, an education, and people that love you.

I feel like your base state of being is discontented and upset.

I'm here for our kid (soon to be). I act positive and talk to you to address these issues calmly. I don't argue because it's not worth it. It gets better then worse. I'm tired.

LORD KNOWS I'm not easy to deal with. I have anxiety, I have abandonment issues. I'm self centered at times. I have bad days. BUT I TRY. I am not the best dude but I put in effort to make your life better. I genuinely care about you. I try to make you happy but you basically say ""fuck you"" to me with your actions and reactions.

I understand effort is relative and you're going through some shit but damn! Just fucking try. 

I lay next to you at night and feel isolated. I just feel disconnected. I ask ""what does this person do to improve my life or ours""? Aside from paying utilities (a few hundred dollars) I can think of very little. Sure you do some shit if it has a benefit for YOU. 

I'm just screaming into the void. I'll stay for now. I still love you but fuck it gets hard some days. I'm so sick of your bullshit.  The only time I'm happy is when I'm working out or running or just alone. You rarely make me happy. I think I do when I buy you gifts or spend time with you... But... This marriage is a one sided chore for me.

I hope this is a phase. I hope we connect again. But... We will see. Fuck this.

Some months ago, after several therapy sessions and serious thinking, I have decided to distance myself from some friends. Both people do not know each other, but I noticed they had the same patterns. I realized they were having a negative impact on me, as I have struggled with depression for most of my life and they themselves are not in the best place.

By all means, they're not mean or whatever, but their speech and thoughts, and the topic we tend to discuss about are always turned to something negative. I have told them several times to seek professional help, because their issues are way out of the scope of what a friend can handle.

I just stopped talking to them, responding to messages. None of them has even tried asking me if something was wrong, and to be honest, this is for the best. They are not ready for the truth with how deep in depression they are and I have no idea how to tell them without hurting them.

I don't want to do a who is suffering the most contest, but I have been through a lot of things and just feel frustrated at someone who doesn't even try when I have been supportive for so long. I just can't deal with all of that anymore, I'm at a point in my life where I want to finally focus and prioritize myself instead of keep giving everything to others.

I have to say that I feel much better these last months because I feel like I've gotten rid of weights. Yet I still think about them from time to time, and I feel a bit bad from what is essentially abandoning them. But also I cannot afford to be the person to pull them, and I really feel like this is the right choice for me.

TLDR; I stopped talking to two of my friends who are deep neck into depression and refuse to take care of themselves because I need to take care of my own well-being, but I still feel a bit guilty.

The age kinda scares me because I realize I am closer to 40 than I am to 20. 

It’s made me really reflect on my life and what I’ve accomplished (or haven’t accomplished). I felt like I’ve lived a “Luke warm” and comfortable life at least on paper. 

I’ve struggled with depression, anxiety, ADHD most of my life and I’ve gotten to a point where I’ve just accepted it. Grew up in an abusive household with a narcissist mother that made my life a living nightmare and traumatized me to the point that it still has lasting consequences to this day. To be honest I don’t harbor as much anger for her these days, but I don’t have an ounce of respect for her. Not having a mother would have been better than having one who fed me poison on the daily for 25+ years. 

Several years ago I made the resolve to never give up trying, despite how hard it was. I embraced anger as my default emotion as it gave me power to actually do what I needed to do. This developed into an anger management issue. 

Anyhow on paper my life seems fine. I worked hard enough despite being a slower learner (ADHD) and ended up working for a few major corporations in my mid 20s and until recently. I was making 6 figures. 

But like I said. On paper. I’ve gone through most of my life feeling like I was alone, unlovable, and with very little to no support. There was a time I wish I had some positive support in my life because I craved it like any human would. I would often see my friends take for granted a loving family who supported their endeavors and raised them right and compare it to my own family who was dysfunctional and broken. 

On top of that I was fed poison and negative narratives by my mother almost on the daily on how disappointed she was in me and how I was basically a failure. That sentiment never changed despite me making double of my parents’ salaries. 

I did make some friends who were somewhat supportive but weren’t really there when things really counted. My closest friends also rejected the idea that I had ADHD, simply because I got so good at hiding it, but that just invalidated my struggles. 

I had to work twice as hard as an average individual for the same result, but the effort was never seen. 

I’ve sort of given up on the idea that I’ll find someone who would be supportive, looked for it for 30 years and found none. 

The fire I used to have about changing my predicament, it’s still there but it doesn’t feel as fierce. And I’m afraid of complacency. More so, I’m afraid as time goes on, my mental fortitude will degrade, the depression will get worse and make me incapable of escaping this tragedy. 

By “escaping this tragedy” I mean my future, if I don’t change it. But as time goes on, I also feel myself growing more tired. 

I’m about to be unemployed and I feel like I wasted my youth working for corps I don’t give much of a sh*t about, and didn’t really live much of life. 

I haven’t dated much as it’s been difficult to find a partner. But also I am extra cautious due to my mental trauma and attachment style. 

I really don’t want my next 9 years to be a repeat of my prior 9. I want to live life more. But this also feels impossible as I am about to be unemployed. I can’t help but feel life has passed me by to an extent.

I don’t get how some people actually enjoy school. Quite literally. Being in high school makes me feel terrible, miserable in a whole combo. The usual factors as to why someone enjoys school to me is:

\- Got a best friend/group of friends. I personally haven’t had a best friend in over 4 years since I get replaced / TBF, I feel like I’m a shitty friend sometimes and I don’t realize it each time :(

\-Want to get a good education for their future, like they enjoy studying or something.

\-A generally optimistic person which I used to be until I drooped completely.

  
I feel like a terrible person each time I misspoke. I would say something wrong out of some random anger (? I feel like I have a short temper) and mess up. I don‘t want to be mistreated all of the time and when I burst I look like a bad person. I dunno. I don’t even want to try studying, I’m tired mentally already at the thought of my mid-terms.

  
Lots of people recommended to ‘be more active in curricular activities’ so yes, I went through with that. What happened? I did managed to land a role but that was after having a mental breakdown in front of my counselling teacher who BTW gave me the role in the club. So it feels like a pity move from her part.

  
I did recently win prizes in two competitions but I don’t feel fulfilled. Maybe I’m not complete as a person, that’s why I feel like giving up. I get sick so often, feeling like some Victorian child. I got GERD, an anxiety attack and extreme sensitivity now as a whole combo including PMS at times like I don’t suffer from period cramps but I got PMS, yeesh.

I just.. don’t want to be here. I would want to move but it feels a little far-fetched for someone like me to move all because of how I felt but it’s a recurring feeling.

 I feel like I’m the issue when it comes to situations like this. It’s not like moving would change anything but what if it did? Maybe I would’ve found my best friend, someone I can trust. I feel alone. I have friends but they are not someone I can confide in. They don’t even bother texting me first. 

I always go on Reddit for advice since well, I don’t have anyone to confide in. My mom may be the closest person I have to talk to but I doubt she’ll understand my emotions like a 16 year old girl would. 

My friends are a long-shot. I don’t like getting advice from someone who took it from a TikTok and decided to use it to feel good about themselves while comforting someone. 

I‘m not any different from any other teenage girl but why do I feel so isolated and discarded? I like things they like too but I’m not fond about them.

  
Sometimes I just cry to myself, regretting every person I’ve ever mistreated. It’s not like I cursed their family bloodline, I just became a little rude without realizing. Do you know how dumb I feel for doing that? It’s so stupid for me to be like that. Sorry I didn’t respond to every video you sent when it showed you thought of me so often. 

I don’t have a phone, it’s not like I could’ve responded as much. I had a BSF 4 years back. She was like my other half. She always understood me and I felt inseparable from her.

 Dunno what happened, maybe how I was or maybe when she got a BF. I miss having a BSF. I’m not a very relatable person when it comes to things I like. People say I’ve got an aura that is unpleasant and it just makes me sadder and sadder. 

I always get so mad and confused when my friends move on from me when we had a great time together for a few months. It was like ‘Well, I’m bored now, let me jump to another friend!’. That’s how it FEELS. Some people admit they do that on purpose for no apparent reason and it makes me sad. I enjoy having someone’s company and being silly but my mom says I’m serious.

 Being serious isn’t really me anyway, I just became like that to cope with my emotions. I like being emotional and caring about dumb stuff with other people. What I don’t like is being abandoned when I try to hang out with people.

Is being a teenage girl really this much of a rollercoaster? I honestly can’t bear this anymore. Witnessing a huge fight between my parents where it got really intense traumatized me. You know what happened? They made up after having caused me substantial amount of stress. So done. So so so so done.

Religious guilt is another thing. Feeling like shite is another. Get both? You feel like you wanna just ☠️. 

Locking in. That sounds like a myth at this point cause I’m way too goddamn unstable since I’ve tried every damn bloody move to make myself feel better.

I’ve been isolated from my surroundings for the past two years. I just use Reddit mostly to read others’ stories or play games online. I never initiate conversations. But lately, I’ve been trying to break out of my shell and talk to people. I might not be great with words, but trust me—I want to talk. Sometimes I even use ChatGPT to come up with ideas just to keep a conversation going. Why? Because I just want to make connections.

Recently, a guy talked to me for two days. It was fun. He matched my crazy vibe. And then—suddenly—blocked me everywhere. Like, why? Did I do something wrong? Can someone just tell me? Why block me without even a word? 

Lately, I’ve been feeling incredibly lonely. It gives me anxiety. I just want to be loved genuinely. I want someone to hold me in a tight hug while I cry everything out until I feel okay again. Honestly, I don’t even remember the last time I hugged anyone. Actually, I’ve never been hugged in my 19 years of life. That sh*t hurts. So bad.

I never spoke to him until it was too late, he never did too, and we've grown too distant at this point.

But I really want to rebuild that relationship, and make new friends, but it's extremely difficult for me to talk to new people. It's almost ridiculous. I overthink everything. ""Is this too stupid? Is this too cringe-inducing?"" ""Will I look like an idiot if I say this?""

It's hard for me to build new friendships, because of that. I really want to have friends. I want friends who we can talk to, send memes to, play video games with, hang out with in person, and so on.

There's someone I find nice. He's a good person and funny, but I don't know how to be his friend. I've talked to him a few times, but obviously we're not friends yet.

I don't know if it's the right word, but I'm bored of feeling lonely, like I don't have anyone I can talk to for even 5-10 minutes, no matter the day. I think I feel lonely.

I'd like to know how I could approach him and other new people to possibly make friends.

I’ve been hiding this as a secret from my family and most trusted friends for years now because I know that someone will tell someone. It gets worse, my family is extremely religious and if they find out about this, They will have me be castrated. I feel as if it has taken away from my masculinity, as I may have pulled my pork too much during puberty that it has severely delayed my schlong size.

It is (maybe) too late now since it has numbed my mind to such a degree that all I think about is an ideal woman. I would like to apologize to all women reading this post who may be offended by what I am going to say. Porn has erased every wrinkle on my brain, it has weakened my masculinity, my ability to love over lust, my freedom, and made me think that women are lifeless, toys incapable of feelings. I fucking hate the porn industry and Rule 34. I have had suicidal thoughts ever since I found out the sheer gravity of one nut I unloaded, that’s one load I let go to waste over some temporary satisfaction. 

I’ve tried counting my days I gotten without gooning since 2023, my longest run as a mere 2 weeks and a half, I did feel great in those two and a half weeks but then I found a new character that had insane goon potential and it broke my streak. 

In short, I blame elsagate videos for my gooning problems. an early childhood of sexually provocative thumbnails and traumatic content has shaped me into what I am today, a boy that hides shit behind his parents back and has to write his problems down on Reddit. And I’m still way too young to be in this type of situation regarding my sexual pleasure.

I am not in a good place really, neither mentally nor physically. Any good subreddits to help help with my problems?

I felt so used and I decided the problem was too bad now. She is way too skinny and is putting herself and baby at risk. And losing all her relationships and friendships. Becoming more depressed and withdrawn. She may even lose me.

I called the 🔌 and told him that she wasn’t being discrete and law enforcement offices we are close to have noticed (truth) and shes at risk for losing her baby. That I didn’t want him or anyone to get in trouble and to never respond to her. He told me he appreciates me looking out and letting him know and I don’t have to worry abt selling to her.

A few mins later my boy is like “Hey look it’s [gf name] over there 👉🏻 “ I look and guess who it is lol it’s my gf with some of her friends. So I texted her again saying “Hey so did your mom finally let you come?” As to which she replied “No” So I said “I literally see you” and she replied “Huh no?  If you really do see me come up to me then” Which is exactly what I did lol and she just started laughing and tbh I didn’t think it was very funny and I was so upset the whole time I didn’t even wanna be there no more. We hangout for a bit and she could tell I was upset and asked me but I just kept brushing it off.

Later that night I made sure she got home safe said goodbye to her and even the way she said goodbye made more mad. She said bye to another guy and hugged him and gave him that little gay ass side cheek kiss thing that really fucking pissed me off and she barely even said bye to me.

Once I got home I texted her out of pure anger about not wanting to see her again and to give me back some stuff I gave her and she really wasn’t taking me serious. I got more mad and said more shit out of anger and that really upset her and I regret it now. I really do love her but I’ve been depressed all day and I just want to apologize to her although I am kind of upset still.

I think my anger issues and jealousy get the best of me. Idk what do you guys think.",Negative,Low Concern,to,"(-19.9160819, -175.202642)",-19.9160819,-175.202642

uni is stressing me out too. last quarter was my worst academics on record and i want to break the cycles but i feel myself falling back into them. i worry about finances and future plans and everything all the time. there's so much to do and i always feel so low on energy and motivation. i've been exploring resources to deal with depression/anxiety that my counselor said i might have, but also it feels like a lot and too much to deal with. but i know i need to try something different, i can't keep living like this.

I wasn’t really supposed to be here. My mom found out she was six months pregnant with me when she was 48 years old. She also had multiple sclerosis and the doctors weren’t sure if the pregnancy was a good idea…but she had me anyway. growing up it wasn’t easy having a older (and sick) mom and it’s something that I’ve kept buried inside of me for very long time. From a very young age, I had to learn how to give my mom her medication and my siblings would always take her side on any issues so I had to grow up pretty fast and learned to suck up my problems. If my mom was ever mean to me or said something horrible to me, I basically had to deal with it because my siblings would jump on her side because she’s older and sick. As you can probably tell by now, my mom and I did not get along when I was a kid and a teenager. Unfortunately, my mom has been really toxic towards me in my life and narcissistic in many ways. I went through a lot of trauma that she ignored and undermined it . She was very emotionally abusive towards me and my father walked out on us so she had a lot of angry towards him that unfortunately got taken out on me. My mom has said and done some horrible and hurtful things to me throughout my childhood and teenage years. But now my mom is 73 and I’m watching her age before my eyes and I can’t handle it. I just want more time with her despite everything and cant imagine a world without her. It is made me incredibly depressed and suicidal. I still live at home with her because I can’t afford to move out and I got out of an abusive relationship so I needed to get on my feet. I don’t have a boyfriend, don’t have friends, I feel like I’m incredibly behind in life. And then I have this looming fear and energy of my mom aging and this overwhelming panic of not having a stable person to go to God forbid of anything and it really overwhelms me. Even though my mom and I didn’t get along I’m faced with this sudden realization that she may not see me have kids or get married and my older siblings have had my mom threw all of their milestones yet and still they call me spoiled because of the youngest, and they refuse to see my side. Sometimes I get so mad at my mom for having me so late in life. I already feel like I wasted my own life and I feel like I’m so behind everyone else in my age and this situation is just another obstacle it seems like. Lately I haven’t been able to sleep properly or even eat because of my anxieties about this. Any words of wisdom would be great. Honestly, sometimes I wish I could just check out of the world and give all of this up. I feel like I’m always met with a lack of empathy constantly ",Negative,Low Concern,,"(None, None)",,

friendship of 10 years is ending......is it my fault or just my birthday curse?? I(19F) have a birthday curse. What I mean by that is every year around my birthday something bad happen and by bad i mean bad. I live in a lower-middle class joint Indian family(12 members btw) and birthdays are a huge thing in my family because thats the only day in the year where you are the main character. on my 7th bday father forgot to buy candy to distribute in my class and i went school crying, it mind sound nothing serious but it is because bday in school are a huge thing for a small kid and it just keeps progressing badly. Around my 8th bday I broke my collarbone but it's a story of other day. Just two days before my 10th birthday my mother ran away from home and was found on a railway station by my father and grandfather. My father's best friend and business partner died around my 13th bday leaving a lot of debt for my father and the business shut down too because of which we struggled alot financially for years and things are kind of looking good now??? My 14th bday was at the start of the lockdown which means whole country was shut, at my 15th bday 5 out of 12 members of my family tested positive for covid. My father wasn't home for my 17th bday because the business i was talking about from above had a customer from then filed a police report saying my father's best friend had did something fraud and police said they would have to take my father for investigation or something like that and since this whole thing and my bday was around weekend my father could also be locked up in jail because the courts are closed on the weekend so he had to leave our city for the weekend.

Things like this happened on every possible bday i had which led to me hating my bday, the only day when i should be feeling most loved and happy and wishing the whole year to just skip my bday date from the calendar. At first i thought it was all in my mind but it happens almost every year and things i mentioned are just a few.

But i think this year's curse is me losing my best friend. So let's call her G(18F) has been my best friend since we were 8 or maybe 9 and ever since she has been the most important and only beautiful thing in my life. I barely had any friends growing up and when i changed my school after 3rd standard I was getting bullied in my new school because of my dark complexion, my middle class background, for not being cool, and many other things and G was the girl everyone wanted to be friends with her but she was in the different section. I tried to talk to my parents about bulling and difficulties in school but my father never really had any time and my mother was very dismissive so after weeks of begging I somehow convinced my parents to let me change my section mid-semester and lucky enough I got to be in the same class as G. My first day in the new class and G with some other girls came to have lunch with me to get to know me and I actually ended up making friends and after lunch G came to sit with me for the rest of the day as I was sitting alone. We talked and became friends and we were inseparable, other than G i was friends with M and N(two other girls from the same class). Us four had a really nice friendship we would have alot of fun at school and everything seemed perfect. I never liked going to school but it somehow started to become my safe space and an escape from my neglectful house. Everything was good until covid hit, we had just finished our final exams for 8th and were going to start 9th standard (so a little side note my school had a whole another building for classes 9th to 12th and it was said once you enter that building you are an adult because it was said that kids in that buildings would date, fight, smoke, kiss in class etc etc and these were pretty big deal considering decorum of a small city school). I was not very up to date with the technology and social media trend and ect. so when our school shutdown and everything went online i was having a very hard time keeping up with everything like everyone from my school was making tiktok playing pubg in group and making new friends online and i was left all alone M and N had started interacting less with me and G had become very social and was always online making new friends. After a whole year when the schools were opened I could physically feel the wall between me and M and N but nothing really changed between me and G there were a few differences but nothing serious. Suddenly our school decided that the will make section for our 10th board class based on our performance in previous exams taken on the things we learned in online classes. My academic performance had fallen down alot during online classes because i never studied during covid but somehow I managed to pass all my exams and secured a place in section-B so does M and N but G was placed in section-C and that's when everything started going down hill. M and N had became a duo and it was like i was third wheeling them all the time, G had made friends with the girl i hated the most, that girl always sabotaged our friendship and always came in between us, our classes were across from each other and i could see G and the other girl from the small window and i could see that other girl taking up my place in G's life very clearly. Soon M started dating and became the cool girl of the group and N started spending less and less and less time with me so to be in touch with G i made an instagram account since we barely met at school but it didn't work distance between me and G was growing bigger and bigger. I performed very bad in my board exams and life at my house became more difficult. M and N chose non-medical for their stream and i was forced into non-medical by my parents despite my hate of science and G changed her school.

Duo and third wheeling saga kept on going and G was having a hard time in her new school so I kept in touch with her and would go meet her at her house which is pretty far away from my house. I was also not having a  great time in school non-medical was beyond my understanding capacity i barely passed my mid-sem exams then i again begged my parents to let me change my stream to commerce and somehow convinced them. I changed my streams mid-sem so i was definitely far behind in syllabus and everyone in class had their own little friend group and i once again became the outcast. I knew almost all the kids in the commerce but they were not my friend so i would sit alone and beg my teachers to let me have lunch with M and N in the other classroom and if I for some reason couldn't i would have to eat lunch alone because of which i started skipping lunch and i was again getting bullied this time it was not that extreme but it really took a toll on me mentally and i fell into depression. M and N never really made any efforts in our friendship it was always just only me saving our friendship from ending like a fool but finally when i had enough i called it quits at our year end party of 11th standard and never talked to M and N again, we would still exchange bday wishes but nothing else and at school we would share uncomfortable glances at each other in hallway but would say hi or any thing else.

The only person i had was G then. and i say this because i obviously had no friends in school and was also struggling to maintain my relationship my parents, and my family so i didn't had anyone to share my problems with and i didn't shared my struggles with G because was also having a hard time in her school and with her studies but we kept in touch here and there. Everything was taking a really bad toll on me and i was falling deeper and deeper into depression.

After 12th me and G we both took a gap year because we both didn't got into college she wasn't able to crack her NEET and i couldn't clear my IPMAT but my CUET scores were good but i wasn't able to make my preference list so i wasn't able to secure a seat in any college. During the gap year I would constantly go visit G at her home regardless of how strict my parents are on such things.

So G invited me to her house on her parents anniversary because they were having some kind of puja and it would be easy to convince my parents to let me go so I did went to her house and spend my whole day there.

G had told me I was the only person she talks to and no one else but that day i say on her phone that she was talking to someone else too now it's not like i don't want her to make other friends and be only with me but she could have atleast told me. I confronted her about this and she showed me her chat with this other person and it seemed like they both had a really deep emotional support for each other which was very different from the things she shared with me. 

I went home that day and realised that i was the only one living in a delusion that i can be someone's only one, the more i think about it the more it gets clear that it was always me who put my everything in the friendship because that was the only thing i had. I was always hesitant before sharing anything with her and when i did open up about things she just kept giving me solutions and reason why i am the only paranoid one in the certain situation while all i ever wanted her to just listen to me and believe me because i know how to solve my problems. She never took a step first, once i even got into a minor accident while going to meet her and i even lied countless time to my parents just so i could go see her but she never came to me. I know i sound selfish but i just want to be loved for once without feeling like i am begging for it.

My depression keeps on getting worse and i took a little break and didn't talked to G for sometime and soon after my father told me to reappear for my IPMAT exam this year so academic pressure is at it's peak. G did tried to reach me throw texts but i kind of ignored her cause i was in a condition to talk to her and if i did i was worried i would definitely harm our friendship more. So i guess she was fed up and she texted me on the day of holi saying that how my expectation with her are too high and that she doesn't deserve my or anyone's friendship and that she don't deserve the efforts i make for her and everything but she can't do that and that we are not made to be with each other. I tried to text and call her after this but she is not responding, i wanted to go meet her but my parents are not allowing me and i can't find a good excuse either.

I guess this is the end of the only relation in my life which i wanted to never end just the thought of having a person i can call my friend whether we talked or not was enough for me. G is the the person i can give up my life for, this might sound exaggerating but if i have to i will without any second doubt.

It was always me who would distance myself from relations and people because i always thought if i walk away first i would be less hurt that's what happened with M and N but with G i never thought i would lose her, i don't know to cope with this feeling of being abandoned this all feels like karma.

I don't know if this happened because of me or my birthday curse...... i can't lose G but i also don't have energy to save this friendship anymore. My IPMAT exam is also in a month and i feel like i am gonna fail once again because i am not even 10% prepared for it.",Positive,Low Concern,Us,"(39.7837304, -100.445882)",39.7837304,-100.445882

If you saw one of my last posts about me talking up my boyfriend, then. Yeah, we broke up after like, two months LMAO. he turned out to be a shitty boyfriend. but that isn't about that!! the breakup barely affected me because he was embarassing as fuck anyway. If anyone has ever seen my account, especially my posts FAR down my acc, there's no doubt they were concerning. talk about second hand embarassment. honestly, idk what to say. I no longer have the urge to kill myself, which is kind of insane, because I'm 17, and like, 5 months ago I didn't think I'd be making it to 18. I dunno how it started honestly! Seth Green is just in everything. I think something clicked when I watched Without a Paddle LOL. I thought he was kinda hot and wanted to watch Can't Hardly Wait because I knew he was in it. Shortly after I watched Can't Hardly Wait, which is now my favorite movie of all time (I've seen it 9 times this year). I'm a senior in highschool, so talk about the perfect time to watch a film. Ever since then, I've been watching every film Seth Green is in. No exaggeration, I've seen *every* film he's in. No matter how small the role. Not only do I love watching movies for him, but I love film in general (I want to be a cinematographer), so watching these new movies has also given me the motivation to watch non Seth Green movies, and I've been averaging 2-4 a day, finally getting through my watchlist. I've been the happiest I've ever been, and I haven't relapsed since January. My parents may still give me shit from time to time, but I don't let it bother me as much as it used to! Not only do I adore Seth Green's acting and characters, but I've seen countless of interviews with him, and he just seems like such a genuine guy. I'm not normally one to look up to celebrities, hell, James Gunn, the director of my favorite franchise of ALL time (Guardians of the Galaxy), is a pedophile, but Seth Green just seems different. He's so down to earth, and I honeslty believe it's because he's never had super huge roles, which I'm thankful for. I admire him and his love for his work so much, not to mention how attractive he is. Especially how attractive he was in the late 90s. Anyways, yeah. he may not be the SOLE reason for my happiness, but he definitely helped kickstart it, and I'm forever grateful for that. Not to mention I'm still thinking about him constantly. (my friends and coworkers think im autistic.) I'm so glad I can rely on watching movies as a new hobby of mine, and I'm just glad Seth Green exists. Not only that, but because I'm so attracted to him, I honestly am not sure anyone else I meet could ever compare to him, which is a good thing!!! I've spent so much of my life trying to be appealing to other people. So much of my life falling for people quickly and wanting to date them for the sake of them giving me the love I refused to give myself. They never did (I have terrible luck with people and love), but that's a good lesson. You truly can't love others before you love yourself, and for the first time in my life, I'm actually content with being single. I love having time to myself and not pouring my energy into people who don't give a fuck and who don't give me the same energy back!!

I don’t think my life is better sober.,"Yesterday was my 8 years alcohol free. I don’t think my life is better sober. I am an alcoholic. Did inpatient rehab as a self referral in the military at 24 and I haven’t had a drink since. I was a daily blackout unless I had duty. I started smoking weed 5 years ago. It saved me. It treated my night terrors from PTSD and I lost 100lbs in 6 months in a healthy way, and am now able to live with my physical and mental disabilities by prioritizing my physical and mental health. But I don’t think I am better off not drinking. My wife left me 6 years ago, I’m a really good dad but still part time. A physically abusive toxic ass relationship after, I went fully insane and thought the government was following me, and then my partner of 2.5 years committed suicide 2 years ago. Considering that’s post rehab, shits not going good to end up there at 24. I never did get in any legal trouble though!

I’m 32 and I live with my parents. I had a good job making good money doing technical safety and rescue where I got to use my brain and problem solve and also do cool rescue stuff. I quit that 6 months ago. I have an IQ of 142 but I chose to work in a grocery store deli because my life has been enough and I just want it to be easy so I have time to coach baseball, ride my bike with my kids and play guitar. 

But I also want to drink. I want to go to the bar and have beers and laughs. I miss the social lubrication of alcohol. I’m awkward as fuck, but I’m really funny and very nice, alcohol fixed my nerves and let me be comfortable. Everyone in my old circle was shocked when I got sober because I was such a good drunk. Even in the Navy I was a stand out sailor, always hard charging even dying from a  hang over. 

I’m not going to relapse because I’m strong and I am afraid of the consequences.  I am proud of myself. This last year was the hardest year of sobriety I have maintained. Happy birthday to me for something I’ll keep doing but really don’t want to. 

Also, Anyone who says that weed and alcohol are the same is an addict, I am an alcoholic, the desire to numb everything with booze has never itched at me the way wanting a J during a T-break does.

I not really sure of what i want, but for starters I don't share the same desires, she wants to have children and she wants to move to the US. Were not from the US and I don't plan on someday living there  
We've been together 3 years, although I care very much for her I don't see a future where were together when she finishes her studies. This is something that we both have talked about prior to me making this post but she just says that well work it out. Yesterday she again tried (at least that's what I think) to try and change my opinion (Babies and moving) and I refuse again to that ideas and told her that I don't want to and if she really wants shes going to need to make her life with someone else (All of this in a very mindful and understanding way) she agreed, but again, she said that will work it out.

Second and I feel really bad for saying this but Id like to reconnect with my EX (21F)  
To give more context to this and try to save my skin, yesterday we hanged out, me, GF, EX and a couple more friends. GF and EX recently became friends, about 3 months ago so that's the reason we hanged out in the first place.  
I was in a very short relationship with my ex that I ended up breaking because of anxiety and lack of self -esteem. That was nearly 5 years ago and I haven't talked to her until yesterday but prior to this I was always having dreams about her and every time I thinked about her I got anxious. At nights I couldn't sleep and ill get lightheaded. I couldn't and still cant bring myself to talk to my GF about this because in other occasions she got very jealous when it was something related to EX.

The reason I want to talk to my EX again is that I want to start anew not like in loving way, I feel like I deprived myself of getting to know her and I also got around to talk to people I needed to make amends and that's what Id like to also do with her. I haven't done anything else but think of consequences of trying to reach out to her in a private setting (direct message on Instagram) I'm in a relationship, shes in a relationship, I don't want to ruin her relationship or hurt mine. I have something else to say but not in a way to justify talking to my EX  
My GF a year ago got in touch with her EX although they didn't have a good relationship, she said to me that she didn't care if that hurt my feelings or if I didn't want to be with her anymore because she needed closure but I stayed. Since that day I'm also a little uneasy about her this also relating to my first paragraph. I not planning to ask for permission because she didn't but i fell bad about doing it without her knowing, I don't want her to go through what I went  
I only had her on Facebook back then and I don't use Facebook anymore so I had no way to contact her but because we got out together an Instagram group was made and I got her IG that way but still haven't followed her o send a message.

I don't even know where to start all of this been brewing in my head for months now and I'm in a point that I cant relate to anyone else also I don't have anyone to talk about this and is getting me sort of depressed. I also think that if I do something ill end up alone, because most of my current friends are also hers (GF and EX). I feel so selfish. I just like to have a second opinion.

I don't know how to start this because I don't know if anyone is even going to read it, but I know how I want to end it, literally. Everything is just black & grey now and I'm so exhausted from getting back up after every ""life lesson"" or ""chapter"". This last one was honestly enough for me to want to just get done with the book... 

The litteral only person (except for my mom i guess) that I had to talk to, that made me think he loved me and that i talked to everyday for over a year, told me that me reaching out to him for help was me being manipulative, he was so cold and cruel, but hes been genuine.This honestly was not my intention and I didnt even know what to say, I honestly just needed someone to be there for me after always being there for other people. I'm sorry if my intentions were selfish, I really just needed someone and he was one of the most important people in my life. 

I called him last night at two because I had been planning to end things for over 2 weeks now. I packed up & cleaned my house, i wrote letters to everyone who are important to me (even if they were no longer in my life) and I even gave my cat away (i thought I could see her one last time but the person I gave her too just blocked me and refuses). Since losing my job a few months ago picking myseld up and rebuilding my confidence feels impossible. The rape, the abuse, the addiction, the abortion, my dad, the constant rejection when I looked for work, my previous 'love', the relapse... I just can't do it anymore. 

About 24 hours ago I called the one person I had left to ask for help last night because he said there is nothing wrong asking for help if I felt like things were too dark. He even told me he also attempted twice and he felt relieved when he he finally admitted to others that he needed help. He told me this while I was busy packing the last of my things and even made me pinky promise I wouldn't hurt myself... That's what snapped me out of it last night and made me decide to ask for help instead of doing the last bit of my cleaning before I go.

 He picked up eventually but he was more irritated than anything else and ended the call as quickly as possible. He said we would talk in the morning, that was enough for me to go to casualty this because I still had some fight left in me and got pre-assessed to go to a mental health clinic. But the one that is closest only has space from Monday and it costs almost R4,000 (ZAR) for the in-patient program (i know thats not alot but atm I can't even afford petrol for R50 and I can't expect anyone like my mom to pay that)... 

So I came home thinking that gives me a week to get the funds for the in-patient program. still had the last of my hope left... Now that one friend said he didn't call back or check up because he feels like Im emotionally manipulative. I didn't even know what to say, I asked for help, i could always talk to him, i told him everything I've been through, he was my partner and said he loved me, he said I could ask him for help less than 72 hours ago, now this. I thought he was genuinely a friend, but after he left me I just... Feels like I was just there because maybe he was lonely and maybe he liked the effection I gave until he got bored... He was really important to me and I genuinely loved him.

I can't do it anymore. I thought I could hold out for this week but I just don't see the point. I'm not writing this as a cry for help, I'm not writing this to manipulate, I'm not writing this to play the victim or for a pity party... I just wanted to get this off my chest in some form sothat there is proof that I tried. I really did. I think people should be able to make these decision for themselves because life isn't meant for everyone. I really tried. I was kind, caring, gave everyone my best. But everyone still left and I got hurt in more ways than I even care to describe anymore. I honestly just can't do this anymore... And I've read about how people talk about death (the ones that have experienced it and came back), and that feeling of relief and peace literally does sound like heaven. 

Im saying the last of my goodbyes this week. Im also writing this now because I need people to know that things like this isn't because of one person or event, its because of an entire lifetime of 'lessons' and damage. Im actually glad I don't have alot of connections left because my main concern was always how this would effect other people. Its something that has been at the back of my mind for since high school. I'm not angry with anyone who ever hurt me, I forgive everyone that ever did me wrong. I'm sorry for being so emotional drained and unbearable to some. I promise I only ever had good intentions. To the people that left me or ghosted me, I don't blame any of you, I would've left myself a long time ago if I had the choice. I just honestly can't do this anymore. Things in life can be absolutely beautiful, and I know that I've changed a few people's lives for the better... So thats enough to say that I know I had some purpose. I posted my poetry, writing and art online so thats enough legacy for me, & even though I never published the book that I wanted to, there's this atleast (and a couple of people know my full story as well, which is enough). 

Thank you to everyone that has made a difference in my life (whether its good or bad), you all shaped me into the person writing this, and I'm grateful that I'm leaving as such a beautiful person instead of carrying on as a hateful/angry one. 

I think I just went through all the final stages of grief while writing this post. I know the sun will always rise, but I'm happy to say that Ive had enough sunsets for a lifetime and I can't wait to see how beautiful that last one is going to be. If reincarnation is real I hope my next lifetime can be spent making a difference in the world. 

Love, CvdW

I never thought at 20 years old, I would be the complete opposite of what I envisioned. 

I haven’t had any genuine friends in a long time. I was extremely lonely awkward and weird kid since middle school. I got bullied, used and exploited from middle to high school. My whole childhood was dedicated to being the model student. I ruined my social skills and interactions in the process. I even was a people pleaser once. Even when I stopped people pleasing, I became alone. I have been alone for a long long time. This got to point where I am a lazy burnout in college. I even picked an easier major like statistics and data science as some sort of retaliation against my parents for pushing me to be a great academic student. It was a way to get back lost time in my high school days. But I now regret picking my major as it has few job opportunities after college. But I also think what else could I have done, I didn’t have the mental capacity of other subjects like engineering or computer science. 

My mother and father frequently screaming and fighting at home was also a problem I had. I also had an obsessive but very caring mom who pushed me academically and was a good person; but she sometimes pushed me too far and too much. 

People always said I will find my friends group and there’s always someone for somebody. I approached and talked to many people and I got no progress in making connections. It took me a long time to accept that it might just be my looks and personality. My personality doesn’t come off as attractive to others, I am not the person who can pull people and keep them engaged. I have a bland personalities with no life stories or proper hobbies. That’s the truth. 

I went from the best student in school to a less than average student in college. I see people in my college who have it all, great physique, grades, friends, networks, looks, internships, career prospects, is multi talented, etc. I try not to compare much but even then; what’s qualities in me are there to appreciate. 

I am fat and obese. Every time I try to reduce weight something triggers my depression which leads to overeating. Every time I go to the gym I am like what’s the point. 

I still hold a desire and sense for adventure deeply. I always wanted to fun memories with friends, wya hung movies, going on trips with friends, singing karaokes with them, studying while having fun with them, etc. But I never had the friends nor the bright personality to fix this. 

I know this sounds very very immature but I don’t know if I have the inner strength and ability to start a job after college. My whole teenage hood and early 20s felt like a waste of time, just studying and grinding away for an unfulfilled youth. I don’t understand what’s the point anymore, now in a job I have to slog another 8 hours under a corporate entity… for what… for money for survival? To join another rat race again… this time the corporate rat race, just to path the bulls… I know this is a privileged thing to say, and I’m sorry, but how can I rationalize my existence like this. Did my pain mean nothing to the universe, do I just keep suffering every moment and day in life? 

I joined therapy and met with different kinds of counselors and used the therapy services in my college and high school too. But even then nothing really changed. I felt a deep emptiness in my heart since 15, void of memories with friends, adventures, chasing grades and academics instead of living out my childhood. There was nothing inside that kid. I contemplated suicide many times and even do now, but I have parents to live for. I’m not even depressed like that, I’m just empty and hopeless. 

I don’t blame my parents for pushing me at all, they did what they thought was best for me and I don’t fault them for that. I just wish I didn’t end up like this. 

I can’t talk to people properly. I have always wanted to be a charismatic person, watching videos and practicing on people. 

I’m an Indian international student, but the crossroads of my destiny seem blurred. The career outlook for international students is bleak, don’t know if I will get a job here, and I can’t return back to India because my field pays nothing in India without prior work experience. Not smart enough for a PhD. Entrepreneurship is super risky and I don’t want to keep burdening my parents . My parents sent me to the US so I can settle down and work in the US; but with the immigration policies that seems like a pipe dream. I feel like I have wasted thousands of dollars of my parents money and there’s no turning back as to how much money I burned from my parents and that I didn’t maximize my college life. I’m really a failure. 

I never had a proper girlfriend in my life. I am 5 foot 7, hairy and have facial scarring  over my face and my personality is trash. I was never the crush of anyone ever and nobody ever had a romantic interest in me. I approached before but got softly rejected. 

So I’m lonely, awkward, weird, fat, ugly, short, lazy, burned out, with no talent, no hobbies, no desire to work, poor resume, etc. I am a failure now. I never was able to become “that guy”. Never able to become the charismatic guy people would enjoy interacting; the guy who was efficient and had career outlook, the guy who had a plethora of amazing memories, the guy with a unique story to his life, the guy with multiple hobbies and talents, the guy who is extremely skilled. I couldn’t even reach close to this person. In the least; I wish I had friends to make good memories with, and I wish I was happy and content. 

With everything that has happened, Now I am supposed to continue adulthood like this, by myself with zero support. I’m just supposed to figure everything out as an adult, when I am wailing and screaming from the inside, and my life seems like a harrowing experience. 

I don’t want to have a victim mindset, so I am not looking for pity and sympathy. I have tried looking for solutions, paths and routes for self improvement again and again but nothing sticks. Truth is… this is just half of the story. But even if I share everything about my life, this text will be thrice the length. I wish I was better, and I wish I wasn’t born. Someone else should have taken my place as my parents child, not me. I’m sorry if I wasted your time reading this… I really am.

TLDR: Became a lonely, awkward, weird, fat, ugly, short, lazy, burned out loser when I had dreams and aspirations of becoming much more in life. Suffering endless disappointment and emptiness. ",Positive,Low Concern,India,"(22.3511148, 78.6677428)",22.3511148,78.6677428

Everyone says that there's a perfect match for every person, some say you build this match through time. I'd love to find that match or build it. But maybe I'm trying too hard.

I’m going through a tough situation and could use some advice or just to know I’m not alone.

My parents are deeply religious (Christian) and use faith as a tool for control:

* If I don’t land a job, they say it’s because of my ""lack of faith"" (even though I send out résumés daily).
* My explanations are dismissed as ""excuses,"" and my efforts are never enough.
* They always had planes to restrict my internet time (2 hours/day, even though I study and produce music online).
* Every mistake I make is blamed on ""spiritual failure,"" not normal life challenges.

This has left me feeling worthless and even suicidal at times. **Has anyone overcome something similar?** I need:

* Tips for setting boundaries with religious guilt-tripping.
* Resources (therapy, books, supportive communities).
* Just to hear I’m not crazy or alone.

But as time passes on, I think that phrase has a little truth in it.

I've done a lot of stuff alone; traveling, going to the movies, trying new things, foods, places. Some times with one or two friends, but mostly by my own. And I enjoyed it.

Of course mostly it's because I have no one to do things with, so I have no other choice. And I think that's what has fucked me up a bit.

I can go on my own time, at my own pace, to any place I want. I don't need anyone else on my adventures. But I've grown disconnected, to my friends, family, ex lovers. One of them didn't told me why they broke up with me, but I understand now. I tend to isolate. I love my privacy, my ""me"" time. Some times I don't even respond to texts or calls, I don't start conversation; or not that often. I don't talk to my family that often either, even though we live under the same roof. I'm addicted to being alone, and I hate it.

Thanks to my tendency of isolation I'm cutting my relationships, friends, family, possible future lovers. It's going to kill me and I don't want it. I hate feeling lonely. I want to feel the connection with someone. But I keep doing it.

I hate it, I hate it but I don't want to stop doing it. I'm trying to change; I'm not very good at it and it'll take a long time, but I'll change.

Why do I want this?:

1. I don't feel much of anything anymore. I can pretend to be happy and actually feel it, and laugh with friends over the phone or in person, but it always goes away. I can't cry.

2. I'm far from home, attending a school that isn't doing much for me. I dread assignments. I dropped a class, only have two now, and still I have no motivation. I voice my dissatisfaction to my parents, my dad tells me I need to continue or go into some totally different field or get into a trade. I can barely find the effort to think about trying anything else.

3. I can't get a job that can sustain myself out here. I feel immense shame getting support from my parents/family. I've used all of my savings and applied to hundreds of jobs, and I didn't take a couple that paid minimum wage. My parents remind me that I need a job and I know this. As tired as it sounds, work sucks. I wish there was a better way to survive.

4. I've gone quiet on so many of my friends back home. They care about me but I've told them I need to be alone. Repairing that now seems difficult. I think my family thinks I'm suicidal. They've been messaging me stuff like ""We're all thinking of (my name)!"" and ""Worried about you, just wanted to say hi!""

5. I love to make music and movies. My PC broke in multiple parts, I would fix one thing and another problem would come up. I have a broken hard drive and I lost so much data. I don't have the money to recover the data, nor do I have the money to spend without guilt on a new hard drive. I've just been stuck in my room in a cycle of wanting to record new music and develop songs with my guitar and hitting walls because I can't. My passions are unavailable to me. I was polishing up a three hour movie I made and I lost the data. I have a cut of it but it's not the polished version I was working on. I can't really do much with it after all these years. I just want to make things for other people and, I suppose, myself, forever.

I want to move out west, or out of the country, meet new people, maybe work on some ranch. These are fantasies. Maybe join a hippie commune and rock climb (I don't really smoke weed though, so maybe I wouldn't fit in). I'd probably be pretty susceptible to joining a cult right now.

Why don't I just leave? I have no money, sure, but also the guilt of disappointing my parents seems too great. I just want to travel, I'd love to be with someone too, maybe travel together, someone who has gotten to a point where they also care as little as I do. (Maybe they exist, maybe they don't. idk how I'd ever meet them.)

I don't know that I want a therapist to ""calm me down"" and convince me to be content with this life that I am getting nothing out of. I don't think I can afford that either, financially. I'm 22 (I know, I'm still young) and have been a college student for so long, I've been making things for so long, and I feel no closer to my goals. I know that's still young, but I don't see things getting much better, because I know how I am. I don't know how to market myself and I often self-sabatoge. I was finally talking to a girl on Hinge (I downloaded it a couple days ago) and she was nice... And then I unmatched because I was too anxious. And I gave up on that, so it's back to being alone with everything, for now.

Can I leave? How? I have my dad's car here. I have a lease that ends in August. I've probably been depressed for years now, things have just gotten worse recently. Sorry, I rambled.

A little background first... I'm a single dad, and have been for the last 11 years. Prior to that, things were going okay for the most part. Then, after 9 years together, I found out she had been cheating with my ""best friend"" for 3 years or so. Apparently all of my ""friends"" knew about it. Needless to say, I told them all to fuck right the fuck off. I only had 2 friends left, who i rarely talked to at the time. I found this out shortly after she told me not to come home, via phone call, while i was only my way home from my overnight job, which caused me literally to be extremely sleep deprived (\~20 hours of sleep a WEEK on average, literally). I found the convicted pedo (who's victim was 5 years old) from across the road sitting in my living room after the 30 minute drive home. He was nailing her too.  He started watching my 2 yo daughter during the day, (after i was forced out) because he was jobless. beccause she fired the sleep deprived babysitter (me) which led to the pedo situation. I forced that whole situation to come to an abrupt end, haha.  The pedo made it possible for me to get sole custody of our two kids without even needing an attorney so i rubbed it in her face, because I could. it was satisfying. I'm pretty much over all that. it's been 11 years. 

I know this is convoluted AF and I'm just feeling sorry for myself.

Anyhow, I live with my 13 old daughter and 16 son. my oldest son is 28 and on his own.

I rarely receive child support ( a whopping $312 a month) and shes $12k in the arrears, which makes it much harder for me being as I'm broke. I simply have a lot of expenses. My bills get paid. Oh, she also lives 3 hours away and only sees the kids maybe 6 times a year, if that. basically, I NEVER EVER get a break (except when I'm at work). so that's that.

In the last several months, I have given it far more thought than i care to admit, but I find myself thinking 'fuck it, I.m so tired of it all. my children are the only thing keeping me above ground'. Just to be clear, I AM NOT GOING TO DO ANYTHING RASH. Ive got people who need me. FUCK! 

And now I'm fucking crying again.

  
I'm bipolar and am medicated, so I have to fight that shit too. For the past 4 years or so, I've been smoking weed at night just to escape shit, but only after 9pm, because I don't want to be stoned all the time. I'm sure that isn't really helping me, but it feels good and I like it. 

  
for the last 6 months or so, I have had no interest in much at all. I spend most of my free time re watching old shows and movies. I'm currently on my third consecutive round of the entire Dexter series. I'm on S04E02 again. I don't have much desire to do anything else. I bought a table saw and a few other things to try and get back into wood working. Ive done that in the past and I enjoy it.

Almost forgot, I haven't been in a relationship or had sex since I separated from my ex. It doesn't really bother me because I only have to answer to me. Although, I'm so fucking lonely, So I guess It does bother me.

I spend a majority of the day in my head, which has created a new problem for me. I don't always vocalize things when I actually do talk to people. People frequently look at me like 'WTF' because the words just didn't get spoken. I simply think it and don't realize I have done so until I get the looks.

I don't eat much, even when my stomach is literally growling. It gets loud AF. I just don't feel like it. That is starting to be an issue too for obvious reasons. I'm still 5'10"" and 170 lbs, so I'm not going to starve to death. 

And the fucking crying starts again. WTF IS WRONG WITH ME???

well, my gun just came to mind. that was fun. NOT!

I'm done feeling sorry for myself for now. maybe I'll add to this. IDK.

Riding my motorcycle really helps with all the shit. Then there is the issue of me going 100+ on the highway because maybe something will happen. if it does, no more problems, I really just don't give AF.

If you made it this far, thanks for listening.

Edit: I really do appreciate all the supportive comments and suggestions. It’s giving me some things to think about.

going figure someday,i don't like my sibling sometimes (NAW),"i don't like my sibling sometimes (NAW) i am not looking for advice here. i know what i need to do. i just need to process these feelings. i can't tell anyone i know irl about this because my sibling and i have an overlapping friend group. we are 18 months apart and have always had a very strong relationship. we had a difficult family life and have been thru a lot together. about a year and a half ago we started sharing a small apartment on our own. things have been rough financially but generally we have had a lot of fun as first time adults and we are enjoying our lives a lot more without abusive family members and poor living situations. 

however, i realized several months ago that i actually don't really like my sibling. they're younger than me and less emotionally mature than me. i just have a lot of small problems with them that have built up over time and have been exacerbated by our new living situation. the biggest being that they depend way too heavily on me for my taste. i have always been a very independent person. i learned how to take care of myself from a young age. i have always kept my feelings close to my chest and processed them in my own way. i am also a high masking low support needs autistic. i don't like PDA, i don't like hugs, i don't like words of affection, those things mean very little to me, but my sibling is constantly bombarding me with hugs and i love yous and such, and it bothers me. part of it is i don't enjoy rejecting them when i know it hurts their feelings, and part of it is i wish they would understand that i don't like hugs, i don't like to be touched, and i don't like to be glued at the hip to anybody. it makes me feel gross to have to hug them all the time, but i know that it makes them feel better. its at least a dozen times a day. i want to be able to have the autonomy to not be smothered like that all the time. it makes me feel overwhelmed and uncomfortable and gross. 

moreover i just don't like talking to them. i can't explain the feeling i get, but it's like an itchy irritating discomfort that makes me enraged. it'll be a normal conversation, like we're talking about what i'm going to get at the store, and their responses just feel so slushy??? wrong??? stupid???? i don't know. i don't know why i don't like talking to them, i don't know why it makes me so angry and i hate feeling like that. i don't like talking to them about work either. i recently got fired and am trying to find a job, but they've been working in a retail position full time for the last several months. i hate it when they come home and complain about customers being rude to them. they get so angry and i feel like an emotional punching bag for their venting and complaining. i've had customers at previous jobs throw things at me, call me slurs, threaten me, etc. you have to let that shit go and not let it bother you so much. i hate how they let every little thing in the world get under their skin and bother them, but then they turn around and get on their soapbox and try to give their friends emotional advice like they know how to deal with their fucking feelings. 

i also hate that they don't know how to cook and refuse to learn. this morning, i woke up and saw they were up as well. bed made, clothes in the laundry, and they were reading. clearly they had been up for a while. i go to take a shower and when i get out, they ask me if i'm going to make breakfast. i hate the way they ask if i'm going to do something when really they want me to give them something. 'are you going to make breakfast?' = 'can you make me breakfast?' 'are you going to go to the store' = 'can you get me something from the store?' i can't stand unclear communication like that. it bothered me especially today because i knew what they wanted for breakfast was completely different from what i wanted to make. i can't stand making breakfast for people other than myself. my breakfast is the one consistent meal i make for myself, exactly the same way every single day, and i don't like having to make anything more than what i'm going to make for myself. sure, i could have said no, i don't want to cook for you, but i don't like to see them upset, and we only have one kitchen lol. it bothered me a lot today that they had been up for at least half an hour but still waited for me to get up. and yes, i understand i am not the one paying for things right now. its the principle of the situation. it's always been like this. they want me to make every single meal, they don't like cooking, they don't want to learn. i try to help them learn but they either ignore me or tell me i'm not helping. it is not my fault our mom was sick for several years and i had to cook for 5 adults at the age of 11 while being a full time student. its not my fault our mom pushed my sibling to the side and forced me to become a secondary mom while she was in the hospital. i want to be my own person. i'm so tired of being my sibling's mother. i hate being a mother. i don't want kids. i don't even want pets. i just want to be my own person.

i can't stand being so important in their life. i can't stand being important to anyone, really. i don't see my sibling as a younger sibling, i see them as a person that also lives with me. we were talking once about the future, and i mentioned living on my own, and they were upset by that. i'm offended that they thought we were going to continue living together forever. no, once i get on my feet, once i find a steady job, i'm not going to keep living with them. i don't even want to live with them now. they leave trash on the floor. they leave clothes in the bathroom. they barely do any cooking or cleaning. they rely on me emotionally when i barely have any space for myself. why would i want to keep living like this?

we have a nightly ritual as well. 'sleepovers' we call them. i get in their bed and we sit up and watch tv. i like to sit next to them and flip thru channels. its a silly thing we've been doing for a while. i have been struggling with gender dysphoria and don't like having my chest touched in any capacity. sometimes they lean on me against my chest and it makes me upset and move away, which makes them upset as well. they know i've been struggling with this. they know that i don't like to be touched but they still try to hug me and lean against me. they also do this fake whining/crying shit that really pisses me off. i know it's supposed to just be a joke but it's genuinely irritating and makes me so angry sometimes. like, you're 21. i don't like the sound of the whining, the frequency, i know that they're joking but it's still so agonizing to me and i wish they wouldn't do it anymore. i struggle with hyper empathy- not the ability to tell what someone is feeling before they say it like those gurus on tiktok, but genuinely. if someone is crying, i start crying. if someone is laughing, i'm laughing. if someone is angry, i'm angry. i hear them whining and it makes me sad because in my autism riddled brain, whining = sad. i don't want to be sad. i don't know why they're so upset. i get frustrated that they're upset for no reason and i want to fix it, but i can't. and it's an endless cycle of anger and frustration and bullshit. 

the other night, i had been feeling upset, and my sibling was abt to get off of work. they take about 20 minutes to get home. i decided to walk up to the store and pick out something for dinner, something i want to make to my preferences, not to theirs. i left my phone because it was on 4% and it would be useless lol. i come back 45 minutes later, and my sibling is standing in the middle of the living room, tears in their eyes, on the phone with their best friend. they thought i had run away or eloped or something. they had been home 15 minutes and thought i had disappeared. i think it was a close sibling psychic bond because i had been fantasizing about leaving for good, becoming a vagrant or something. i think that event changed my mind about a lot of things. they pretend to whine like a baby because they feel safe enough to be vulnerable around me. they want me to cook for them all the time because i make good food. they want to hug me and say i love you all the time because they love me. and i love them too, but i can't meet them where they want to meet me. i still have to mask around them because their emotions are fraglie and whenever i unmask, they think i am being cold and rude. it just breaks my heart that they can be their true self around me but i can't be my true self around them. it's unfair to me, and i spent my whole upbringing being the grown up kid while they were relentlessly babied. i don't know. thanks for reading. thanks for letting me post. i'm going to figure this out someday.",Negative,Low Concern,,"(None, None)",,

To this my boyfriend got suspicious and asked questions such as ""is this guy straight and in a relationship?"" to which Chris said yes. My boyfriend and I decided that we weren't going to say anything and just leave Chris be because feelings are feelings and as long as he isn't making any moves or my boyfriend is uncomfortable then it should be fine.

Turns out that was wrong. For context, my bf went on a spring break trip with some of his friends and regularly goes out with his friends and my friend quite often. Chris was often invited to these outings but he says no quite often. After returning from spring break Chris tells my bf that he’s being a terrible friend because he’s not spending time with him and it seems like he prefers going out with his other friends and that he’s jealous about that. Additionally, Chris gave my bf an ultimatum of either “fixing” their relationship or just acting like roommates. My bf said that he needs a day to think about what Chris has told him and to calm down. I told my bf that it seems like Chris is mixing up his romantic feelings and friendship feelings and is expecting more from their relationship due to those feelings. 

My bf has another conversation with Chris the day after saying that he shouldn’t be the dictator of Chris’s happiness, and confronting Chris on his feelings to which Chris comes clean about and says “that the way he feels about my bf, he hasn’t felt for anyone ever before but if he had to put his feelings on a scale it would be 30/100.” After this my bf recommended some distance between them and just started hanging out at work, with me and in his room more often. 

Due to this Chris has been very depressed this week. If Chris came home and I was over he would punch the walls, punch himself hard enough to give himself a concussion, and just act very passive aggressive. Additionally, my bf went out to dinner one night which made Chris jealous so in response he drank half a bottle of vodka in the span of 3 hours. Chris eventually had another conversation with my bf where he said he feels like if they didn’t have this conversation he wouldn’t be here anymore. To note: Chris has just started therapy this week because his classmates called the cops on him because they were concerned and the school found out. 

Today, Chris, my bf and I all went out shopping which was something Chris recommended we all do together. However, this morning while I was getting ready, Chris told my bf that he only wanted my bf and him to go so they could work on their relationship. I still ended up going and Chris was depressed and mad the whole time so we ended up going home early. I told my bf that I believe Chris wanted this to be a date between them and that while Chris’s feelings are serious and should be taken seriously It feels like a lot of it has been just to get my bf's attention so that distance can’t be had. 

When I'm around Chris all I feel is anger, discomfort, and like most of the stuff Chris is doing is for attention because I personally don’t believe he has moved on or that his feelings have lessened for my bf. This situation has caused lots of stress and anxiety for my bf and I’ve been trying my best to support my bf while not letting my own feelings navigate how he figures out his friendship with Chris but it’s been hard. I feel like I haven’t been able to voice my own opinion or really get to express how I feel without making either of them feel worse or being looked at as the bad guy. It’s exhausting.

I will sum up what happened. Around 2015-2018 I dont have any memory. I took a blow to the head in a car crash. I was later prescribed metformin as a result of weight gain.

I seen auras (damage to the occipital lobe of the brain) with the luck that the damage was temporary.

I nearly died. I am diagnosed with ADHD and my worst symptom has always been ADHD self-talk.

As a result of this several people in one of the intelligence communities (though I think they were CIA) arrived at my door step. Though at the time I didnt know that.

As a result my self-talk went apeshit. I began screaming in anger for hours if alone. I began begging my wife to not leave me alone because I couldnt control what I was saying and frankly it was driving me fucking crazy.

Having gone to a neurologist they basically said “yeah this should clear up.” It didnt.

The intelligence communities used multiple people to effectively disinform my entire family after harassing me over said events and as a result I dont believe voting works anymore.

Several people in the intelligence community in and around where I lived would literally approach me and scream in my face in an effort to instigate violence out of me.

Later they began bogging my life down by deliberately slowing down paper work as I just tried to live a normal life with my wife. Literally jumping to the conclusion that I am “hiding my disorder.” Something every doctor, and therapist and most jobs have heard at some point.

When it was discovered that I had actual tangible evidence of my claims (not the crash) that I was being harassed by the intelligence communities my house was broken into and it was smashed up.

In that time frame I was slandered as a liar, having schizophrenia, and was effectively violent and dangerous.

Im none of those things.

Upon leaving my wife whos own disorder was preyed upon causing her to beat me, and she is now on anti-psychotics, as well as anti-depressants, I got blamed in my home town.

Despite directly telling those who investigated me all of the above information multiple times directly to their faces and in the case of the crash showing some of them proof.

I have literally had my life ruined by the federal government over a car crash. And where as before I was literally the most flag waving, veteran, person you could have ever met I fucking hate this god damned government now. I dont believe voting works.

I cheated on my fiance with my ex. I'm 18. My ex tried to kill himself a couple weeks ago and me and my friends made a group chat. Me and him got close. My friends did not get close to him. My friend ""talked"" to him for a bit. I was jealous and glad to get closer to him. We share birthdays (1 day apart) and we went out with his family and went to the movies. We took ""honey packs"" and left mid movies to fuck. Check my comment replies and posts to get a better understanding. I do not feel guilty so if u wanna tell me that i'm immature, unloyal, etc. take it to my DMs.

I am depressed and have been since the 5th grade. I do these things because i have no regard for others emotions nor my own. I know i do wrong and i treat them like a joke because i can't treat it like anything else. I ended up in the mental hospital twice and got rid of the help i had AKA therapy. I treat my friends whom are mentally not well like shit yet i chase around my ex like i have nobody else that wants to talk to me.

I love my fiance and i planned my future around him. Even after cheating on him with 2 guys before my ex in which i did feel guilty about. i lead my suicidal ex on into thinking that we're soulmates even though i have no regard into keeping our affair alive. I went through his phone several times and apparently i'm the only thing he's got going in his life. I don't know how i feel about him. We had a bad breakup last year that was entirely my fault and i took all my anger out on him and used him as a punching bag, hence our breakup. My ex is my fiances friend and has been since around 2 years ago, they met in high school. He knows i'm getting married and i shouldn't be with anyone but loneliness lead to a jump rope around my neck.

I have no way to cope with my issues except for smoking my exs weed pen or hitting one of my friends vapes, even though my fiance went through my phone and found me having an affair and i blamed it on being high. He told me i wasn't allowed to be intoxicated but i drink and smoke.

I am usually a pretty positive guy but idk this past year has just been kicking my ass. I just recently moved schools because my last school was soul crushingly hard and I just could not go there anymore without feeling like a dumbass. But then I transferred schools at the semester and its really just been hitting me recently how hard of a change it has been. I went to the same college my sister did, and played football there. So while it did feel like I was in her shadow at times (she was a senior while I was a freshman) it also came with an almost built-in social life. I knew a lot of people from my school because of my sister and had the entire football team so I never really felt alone. I also had my group of friends there that I would consider ride or dies. At the time it felt like I could not do anything without the judgement of someone I knew looking over me.

 The first half of this semester was great, I was meeting new people, relieved from the easier work load, I was happy. But ever since spring break ended I have just had this overabundance of loneliness. I have tried to make a good group of friends here but my roommates are all seniors, so while i love these guys I know that they're about to be gone and I am back to square one. Problems with girls have also been killing me. I wont lie at the start here I was just looking for short term flings, but now as I look for something more real, it seems every girl I talk to hangs out with me once then we don't text anymore. I feel like at this point all i ever do is go to class, do homework in my room, then smoke and play video games with the occasional workouts throughout the week. I just feel isolated at this point because I don't really have any good friends here that I would hanout with just because like I did before.

I just needed to type this out because I don't want to talk to anyone I know about it personally to this extent, but I just feel like I have not been 100% happy in a long time. I know it just sounds like I am asking for a pity party, I just needed to get all of these emotions off my chest somewhere, and I mean we all know the title of this sub lol.

Note that these aren't the same thing as depressed people, even though there's often overlap. My interpretation of ""miserable"" in this context is a chronic mindset that leaks out onto other people in a repeatedly draining or upsetting way, whereas depression is of course a mood disorder that can even plague people who make an effort to outwardly process struggles of themselves and loved ones through the lens of being uplifting and emotionally warm. Being miserable is a trap, overcoming it is a skill that leads to an improved quality of life. Overcoming it can be a stepping stone to reducing or overcoming depression. 

Miserable people tend to be bitter and critical, don't do a ton to improve the stuff that's shitty about their lives, and spend more time talking shit and telling others what they should do rather than actually doing anything interesting or meaningful themselves. They try to lead by criticism rather than example.

Some people are miserable after a rough patch, others are miserable as a personality trait.

Life has quietly grown heavier for so many of us. It’s not just about bills or politics or a rough economy—it’s something deeper. The world has lost a softness it once had. A sense of community, decency, rhythm. Now, it feels like we’re all running—rushing through life, overworked, overstimulated, constantly bombarded with the next crisis, the next expectation, the next reminder that we’re somehow behind. We scroll through perfect lives, perfect bodies, perfect relationships—and feel the weight of our own imperfection more deeply than ever. It’s lonely. Even in a world more connected than ever, it’s so lonely.

Socially, people have changed. Or maybe, they’ve been reshaped. There’s a coldness now—like everyone’s shielding themselves from disappointment, so they hurt first or care less to protect their hearts. Entitlement has grown—people want love, attention, money, and success, but without the responsibility, without the effort, without the humility it takes to truly build something lasting. There’s a lack of shame where there used to be self-reflection. A lack of manners, empathy, or just the basic consideration of how our actions affect others. Everyone is obsessed with being “real” or “unfiltered” but few seem interested in being kind, grounded, or honest in a way that actually matters.

Emotionally, so many people are just trying to survive. Mental health struggles are widespread. People carry trauma in silence, often unaware that it spills into how they love, how they speak, how they vanish without warning when things get a little too real. And that’s the heartbreaking part—so many are hurting, but instead of healing, they cope by detaching. By ghosting. By chasing highs. By numbing. They avoid anything too deep because deep things require vulnerability, and in this world, vulnerability feels like danger.

So, what does that mean for someone who wants something solid? Someone who craves real love, with shared goals and a life built on trust, teamwork, and quiet understanding? It means you’re swimming against the tide. You feel it when you try to connect and are met with half-hearted effort or confusing games. You feel it when you show up with clarity, and they show up with chaos. You wonder if you’re asking for too much—but in truth, you’re asking for the very thing this world is starving for: something real.

And it hurts. Because you know you have a lot to give. You know your love could be a safe home for someone. But every time you try, it feels like you’re met with people who are too broken to receive it or too distracted to even notice. It makes you second-guess yourself. It makes you tired. It makes you wonder if stability, loyalty, and growth are old-fashioned dreams in a world chasing temporary pleasures.

But the truth is, you’re not wrong for wanting what you want. The world might be loud and messy and shallow in so many ways, but there’s still a quiet group of people—like you—who are holding onto hope. People who are rebuilding themselves, choosing peace over noise, choosing depth over trends. It’s just harder to find them because they don’t shout. They don’t perform. They live quietly, and they love intentionally. But they’re out there.

Also this might be a long one.

For some background, I (25M) have always been kind of sheltered and it made more sense to my parents, when I was diagnosed with autism in kindergarten. Friendships are hard to keep and for most of my life, dating was out of the question. Not that i didn't want a relationship, but my main strategy for some time was: Talk to girl, make friends, keep talking to girl until she confesses feelings. To no ones surprise, it never worked out. It lead me to a very toxic mindset, which I held for a long time.

When I got to uni, I started making friends who encouraged and helped me into to become much healthier mentally and emotionally, and I decided to keep working on myself, until the 3rd semester. A new girl (we'll call her Emily) joined the class, and we very quickly clicked as friends, while I thought she was attractive, I never developed feelings and continued to try not to. I was getting more into dating apps at the time, and I wanted to get more seriously into it. This was until I started to develop feelings for Emily and long story short, she rejected me. I never even told her anything, I had apperently just subconsciously made it way too obvious. 

I took it about as well as I could have, spending the summer getting over it, while still remaining friends with Emily, as we did still vibe as friends. This, along with my other friends getting me to really date more seriously, I was getting to feel much better, leading me to get better at dating, even going on my first ever real dates. Everything was going great, until a night where me, Emily and some others were at a small party. During the night I had talked about a girl, that I was talking to and it was going really well. Later on, the others left to go find someone else, leaving me and Emily alone. She began talking about having spoken to her mom, who said i'd be a good partner, and I was getting more uncomfortable with the conversation, and I tried to respond as if she wasn't insinuating what I thought. It was then she told me to stop overthinking so much and kissed me out of the blue, no consent. After a second of trying to fathom what was happening, I pushed her off and tried to explain to her, that I was over this, I was talking to someone at the moment and I was at a point, where I only wanted to be friends with Emily. She proceeded to tell me that she had changed, and kissed me again, absolutely without consent. I don't fully remember the conversation afterwards, only that it ended with me wanting to find the others as soon as possible.

The next day, when we had a chance to talk, Emily started off by saying that she was sorry for catching me off guard, but she still wouldn't back off, she was determined that we were ""meant to be"". This started a slow disconnect between us, the girl I was talking to became my partner (Call her GF), and me and Emily eventually just stopped talking.

After a couple of months, I started to realize that night had affected me more than I initially thought. That feeling of confusion, powerlessness and fear that should I talk to Emily again, she would try to sabotage my relationship. Mind you, Emily never showed any interest in a relationship until I started dating other people, making me have this thought in the back of my head, that I was just a source of attention. I eventually confronted her, really only expecting an apology, and I never even got that, I got reasons as to why she's been feeling bad since we lost contact and how that's not an excuse for her actions. It was then and there I decided to cut off ties to who was possibly one of my closest friends. 

Just so the ending is less depressing, I have become a much healthier and happier person for it, and my relationship with GF is everything I could have ever wanted and more.

My Father 58M, retired 6 months back and has developed a severe case of Depression since last 1 year. Maybe he has lost purpose or maybe we did not notice his true nature in the shadow of his absence from our lives die to work. Since he has retired, he has stationed himself at the centre of the drawing room in a Charpoy (Khattiya) leaving his station only for essential activities. He does not change his clothes for days until harshly told to do so. He questions each and every thing that me and my mother talk and do.  He is in costant worry and creates a ruckus in the home saying things  which cannot be considered civil. The topic of worry keeps changing.  Initially it was a home loan that he had taken to create a second floor. We paid that off. Then he started worrying about potential raid from Income tax due to certain amont of money in his bank account. He withdrew the money and it is sitting idle in our home. Me visiting my friends or my mother visiting her siblings will also make him worry thinking every other  person on the planet is trying to rob us and we are fools to fall into their traps. Topics of worries change but him creating a ruckus remains constant.

Earlier, I worked in Mumbai but had to return to my hometown as my mom was not able to handle him. This is going on from last 1 and a half year and by god's grace I found a job 50 kms from my hometown just when he retired which I commute daily.

I initially thought this might be temporary and will fade away once he settles in his retired life but it is only increasing. We have tried counselling ourselves and made him understand about his unnecessary worries. We have tried taking professional help after much force but he would throw away medicines saying nothing is wrong with him. We ave taken counselling without him being aware and are giving medicines in food as per doctor's recommendation. We have threatened him multiple times of leaving him alone and have left him twice. But then he would go all soft and cry and we would come back but the same thing continues the very next day. We have also tried to ignore him and let him do whatever he wants but we are not able to keep cool after certain point. He is all alone and does not share close bond with anyone.

My results were really bad and my parents were supportive to me for retaking the exam again. In the country i am living you're choosing your university and major at the same time and your test results determines this and you can take this test every year but this exam is held once a year so you need to wait. So i am currently in that year where i am studying to take this exam again and succeed this time. And the problem is here, i am not studying. It is more like i can't studying. I am burned out.

I used to be an overachiever academically and i was able to get into one of the best high schools in my country. Yes we also have an exam for high schools too. I went to this boarding high school that is far away from my parents so that i can leave this house and this city. And my plan worked.Everything seemed good and i was happy for a while. Then my academic success dropped. Staying in the dorm was like hell. My mental health was getting so bad and i got diagnosed with depression and anxiety. I started taking antidepressants. I couldn't start therapy because i couldn't convince my parents. They didn't care. My parents are abusive and they neglected my emotional needs all through my life. The only time they showed any interest in me was when i showed academic success. In the beginning, like when i was in primary school i just showed it naturally. I was good at school but as time passed they started to expect that success from me all the time. They didn't let me try anything because it could affect my grades and academic success and i was doing good for a while but after i got into high school everything collapsed. I think pandemic affected too but the main reason is my parents.

This is the story of how i am in this situation right now. So for retaking the exam i am back again my hometown and in this house. I don't have any friends here because i was in another city all through high school. My mental health is still bad and most importantly i am burned out. I can't study and studying is all i know in this world. I am really serious i don't know anything else. I don't have any skills, i am not good at anything except for stuyding. All my life all i did was studying. Right now my parents are still the same and they expect me to study all the time so i am at home and pretened to be stuyding all the time. I really can'T do this anymore. I don't have anything else going on for me and i know this is the only thing i am good at and that i don't have any other choice. I should just study but i can't.

  
I really hate this. I can't even open up a book without getting triggered. I am having panic attacks and after a while i just couldn't take it anymore and i completely stopped even trying. I don't even know what kind of job i want to have in the future. I don't even know what i am interested in. I don't know what i am gonna choose as a major. I am not ready for anything. Thatis why right now when my parents asks me about my test results i lie. I am not proud of myself and i hate myself for this but this is my only choice. If i tell the truth to my parents they are really gonna kill me. This may sound like an exeggration but it is not. They are gonna yell at me, insult me and tell me all the worst things in the world and i really can't take this anymore. I would rather die than hearing these. I really do. The way they look at me, the expressions they have, the words they use against me, insults and insults around everyone. They are not just saying these to my face. They also bring it up around everyone and humiliate me. And i know i really can't take it and that is why i lied and thought i can fix my results before they find out but i can't.

ive got a high school diploma in graphic design. i enjoyed working with all the programs but never felt enough. my friends and professors have told me i have talent but i dont see it. i feel like im just doing enough to be better than the average person, but when it comes to work in an environment full of other peoples interested in the same field as mine – im just not that good.

i wanted to enroll in communication design but there's an entrance exam and i am SO AFRAID of not passing it. it's been two years... two years of trying avoid what i actually enjoy because im afraid of not being enough.

2023: i first enrolled in painting, which had no entrance exam, but left after only two months because i knew it wasnt the right choice. so i got a job to make something positive out of the time i was ""losing"". one of my friends, unlike me,  actually tried to get in but failed.

2024: then i enrolled in a completely different field, humanities.  i started a language and literature course to study korean and japanese, two languages i love but apparently not enough to dedicate 5 years of university to them, because at the end of the day what i really want to do is graphic design... that friend i mentioned tried again and passed this time.


im young, im barely 21 so i definitely have time. the ""only"" problem is money. when i first enrolled in painting i had the chance to get a scholarship, but since i left i couldn't ask for it again when i enrolled in humanities. so my mom had to pay for my accomodation. i can ask for the scholarship again once i get into 2nd year.

i started getting pretty depressed because of no motivation and basically no social life + seeing the aforementioned friend's works brought me a mix of envy and melancholy.

the rent is 300€ a month. i have made up my mind to stop attending uni and get a job, i actually have an interview tomorrow. i want to repay my mom for the money she spent on me until now and then finish paying the rest of the rent by myself.  i dont want to disappoint her. she's single and without a job because of health reasons. i dont want to weigh on her financially.

but im so afraid of not getting the job and im also afraid of telling her. i dont want her to get mad at me... im planning to get the job first and then explain her my situation, so i can prove her im determined. but what if i really wont find a job :( im feeling anxious and i hate capitalism lol",Positive,Low Concern,,"(None, None)",,

when i was younger i asked my dad if my constant questions were annoying which he told me that i should question everything and so i did. when my dad didn’t know the answer to my questions he would tell me what he believed so for example when i asked him about clouds,aliens or magic he would tell me his ‘conspiracies’. 

i once asked him what happens after death (which in hindsight is a scary question from a 5 year old), to which he thought people were reincarnated. i said i think people choose between going to heaven or being reincarnated. but i got a bit upset becuase i realised that if i was reincarnated into the person i am now, i have no memories of my past lives and that means that when i die i wont remember my dad so i told my dad i would like for him to be in all my lives and that people remember their past lives when they’re in heaven.i asked him what he thought he would be reincarnated as and he said a plant, which baffled me becuase i was thinking of being a wolf. i asked my dad what animal he would be. he took a while to think and then he said he would be reincarnated as a bird maybe an owl. of course this baffled me because i hadn’t even thought of birds or fish for that matter. he had me beat becuase of course a bird was the obvious answer, i’d get to see things that i can’t see now . we spent a good while talking about animals until my next question came to mind and the conversation was dropped. 

my grandads death devastated me and the only comfort i could find was to write about his new life, his life as a flower on a hill with a beautiful view of a valley. sadly my dad joined my grandad when i was 16 and so i found my old notes and wrote about the two flowers with a beautiful view. a year later my grandma joined them on that field. i get angry,upset, depressed thinking about how my dad could leave me but i try to find peace for my dad can stay in that field as he has promised to join me as a bird or a wolf or a fish or even a tree. 
my dad might of been bigger than this life but he promised me another lifetime of questions so i’ll use this time to think of some good ones. ",Negative,Low Concern,n’t,"(37.9456724, 23.7139908)",37.9456724,23.7139908

I’ve been living in the same place for nine months, but only for the past three months have I been living alone, since my housemates moved out.

The apartment has three floors — the first has one room and the laundry area, the second has one room and the kitchen/living space (that’s where I live), and the third floor has three rooms. All of the rooms have private bathrooms.

I had been feeling really good these past few months living alone. I have friends who live nearby, and I go out quite often, so I haven’t been feeling lonely at all.

But starting last week — maybe a little earlier — I began hearing strange noises from upstairs. They sound a bit like footsteps, but only one or two at a time, or sometimes like a very light door opening or closing. Especially at night. Now I have theory that the very heavy blinds make this noise when the wind hits them but it doesn’t help me calm down at all.

It completely destroyed my mood and sent my anxiety through the roof. I no longer feel comfortable in my room or even in the apartment.

It got to the point that I texted the landlord to say I’ve been hearing weird sounds and asked them to come check the rooms.

Now, to clarify — all of the upstairs rooms are locked right now. But on multiple occasions in the past, painters or handymen have left them open — and I mean multiple times.

And I know no one’s there, but I still feel like someone is, to the point that I can’t calm myself down at all. I even left paper crumbs upstairs today to see if they move when I check later.

I’ve been diagnosed with depression and have been on medication for it for four years. I’m currently tapering off under the guidance of my psychologist, and I’ve noticed a spike in anxiety — especially health-related. But I’ve never felt this kind of fear or anxiety before.

She never got to see me graduate. My dad ran out on my mom and I when I was a really little kid, and as long as I can remember, she was my second parent. I loved her so much. I love my mom mom, too, but she’s hard on me a lot. She and I have a bit of a rocky relationship because I always felt like I couldn’t run to her without judgement.

Ever since my godmother died, I can’t stop thinking that I miss my mom (being her). Stuff happens, stuff goes wrong, stuff goes right, and I want to call her more than anything. I wanted her at my graduation. I wanted her there SO BADLY. And I didn’t get that, and she’ll never be there again for any of those big days. I’ll never again get to go to 7/11 with her. We won’t have movie nights anymore. I won’t get to ride around in her truck with her arguing over radio stations. I will never get to give her another handmade present. I won’t even be able to give her a damn gift card.

She always got me, too, you know? I’m autistic and really struggle with people pretty often. And she always respected my boundaries. She always helped me with my special interests. I don’t know how many times the woman would watch A Knight’s Tale with me and let me explain every minute detail over and over just because she loved that it made me happy. She knew I always dreaded my birthday because a lot of my relatives would just get me socks and stuff and she’d always drive me to go get things i really wanted, made it a fun day out for us two. 

It’s just hitting me really hard right now. It always hurts, it’s a wound I can’t really heal. That the most supportive person in my life died when I was just 18. 

And then I feel guilty, because I also love my mom mom. She’s done so much for me, and she cars so much.

With my godmother, she always got that i understood that I had made a mistake when I made it, and that I already feel awful. My mom always lectures and rubs it in. I get it, she loves me, she’s doing it because she cares, it just chafes when I call her upset about something and she starts in on a lecture again like I don’t already get it. I feel like I can’t tell her stuff because I don’t want to hear her tell me to do something she says will work that won’t for me for the one millionth time. 

And i miss my godmother being the buffer, too. For so long she would kinda run interference between me and my mom. We’re both big personalities and we have a tendency to talk past each other. My godmother always heard us both out and figured out how to explain it all.

I want her back so much. She was one of the safest people in my world. And one of the others, my brother in all but blood, died the year after her in a car wreck. I barely survived that depression after that. 

But I did it. I graduated and I moved and I got a job in my field and I have a cat and hobbies and sometimes I even go to the gym. I’m starting to reconnect with people i accidentally cut myself off from while I was just trying to survive the next day and I’m meeting new people too and I’m getting out there socially. I’m still not fully out of the woods on the grief. Sometimes I’m not even doing good at all. But slowly but surely, I’m doing it. I’m fucking doing it. I’m proud of myself. I’m going to start learning to drive and finally conquer my terrible driving anxiety.

The loneliness has given me a physical ache in my chest. I've spent the day periodically crying.

I have been lonely for so long. Yearning for love, yearning for the chance to be seen. The few men who I become vulnerable with turn out to just want sex, or validation and disappear. I have gotten ghosted more times than I can count. The apps are filled with men who want to fuck me and leave.

It's embarassing, to be my age and to admit all I want is to have my hand held by someone who wants to. To be in the arms of someone who wants me there. It's like I have this weight of love I want to give someone and nobody wants it.

Then my therapist and the internet will tell me that I need to love myself first. ""Work on yourself!""  But when the depression from being alone is so heavy, how do I get up to start that? What do I do when the pain is so deep that I don't feel worth loving. Don't feel worth the effort.

Yes, there is a police report. Not much came of it, despite numerous medical reports, medications (my doctors still argue to this day about whether I had a STI or UTI, as I didn’t respond to four medications and almost ended up in ICU after five months), a pregnancy that I didn’t carry to term due to scarring on my fallopian tubes and beating myself with a hammer, a hysterectomy due to long term pain due to violence/damage, and therapy/treatments (I see three therapists, two trauma specialists). It’s hard to prove that kind of stuff without witness’s/video or text evidence. Since then, I’ve had seizures and my health has been rapidly declining. I do have bertolotti syndrome, which I was born with, so maybe it’s not related to the rat poison, but I’ve been losing mobility in my legs for the past couple of years since I fell down the stairs. I’m being passed around specialists (spinal surgeon, rheumatologist, and neurologist) likely due to my age (23, almost 24f). I recently had an epidural and cortisone injection for the second time, but this time it made eveything way worse. 

I’m trying to date (lonely and want connection, just as most humans do), but my legs keep giving out and I had to be carried to and from the bathroom on my last date, which was humiliating, but luckily my date was extremely kind and compassionate. Doctors are arguing over whether I have RA, muscular dystrophy, neuropathy, or if it’s from my bertolotti syndrome. I can’t seem to find answers and I’m tired of being in pain every time I stand up. I’m tired of living with the trauma. I’m so freaking tired. I don’t want to do this anymore. Codeine doesn’t relive my pain, and it’s the only thing they’ll prescribe (I’m allergic to hydrocodone). Oxy doesn’t really help either. I don’t know what to do anymore. I don’t know how to live with this anymore. I just want it to be over, but it never seems to end. I need support, but I don’t know where to get it. The r* crisis center won’t let me go to group therapy because they say I’m too traumatized and need more therapy. I feel so freaking alone and don’t know what to do. I can’t drive. I’m stuck at home. I can’t work and am fighting for disability, but I want to work if possible. I want to help people, but I’m drowning in my own issues.

Imagine your cognition being described as ""sluggish."" Makes me feel like I was born to be humiliated and laughed at. Not sure how much more losing and embarassment I can take anymore. Unlike me, my parents are both neurotypical and have very good social standing, are well liked and well known by many people. So I cant just hide my shitty existence. I have to present myself to people as their son. Too bad the defective, malfunctioning genes still found me despite there not being any signs of them in either parent. The thing that haunts me the most is what my parents first imagined me to be when I was first born. My uncle told me that my dad was so happy to see me and yelled ""THATS MY SON"" when I first came out of the womb. I wonder what he saw me becoming in that moment and beyond, what he wanted to see me grow to be. A great soccer player like him, a relentlessly hard worker, or what. But instead I just barely exist and hes had to really manage his expectations.",Negative,Low Concern,,"(None, None)",,

Don't anymore but I also don't have anyone to tell about this.,"Planned on killing myself this weekend. Don't anymore but I also don't have anyone to tell about this. In November I decided I would take my life on April 13th. My depression became severe as I started to realize that I'm alone in my experiences, at least here. I probably have more than depression as I have been going through psychosis a lot more as of late. It's one of the things my mom passed down to me. I've also been dwelling on traumatic events from my childhood and even remembering new ones. My life was hell, always has been. My parents have acknowledged that themselves so it makes sense why I would want to kill myself. 

I don't want anyone in my personal life to know how close I got to doing it. I don't want to share that burden with them but I know for a fact some people saw the signs. Specifically my mom and dad. They're able to read the subtle cues in my body language, tone and behaviors. To most people I appear emotionless but to them I come across as very expressive and they've picked up on something. My parents literally came over this weekend and my mom greeted me by saying ""I'm surprised you're not dead yet"" in reference to how I've been behaving lately. 

I don't plan on killing myself on April 13th anymore, but I'm sure as hell not doing nothing that day. I think being in this city depresses me, as beautiful as it is. I need to see the trees, experience silence and clean air so that's what I'm going to do instead of taking my own life. Hopefully something finally changes in my brain that day. Maybe I'll finally see the value in living and no longer get this close to dying by my own hand time and time again. I'm tired of living like this, but maybe I'm just not in the right location.

It’s probably one of the most confusing things I’ve ever done. I want to attend a four year and I want to make alright money in life it’s just difficult. 

Most of the college in Texas are either for super smart kids with 3.8s and above or are not as good but cost a damn fortune to go to. While I’m not poor, my parents could not afford it unless I get a scholarship. But my parents really really want me to get into these and now I want to aswell I think, idk tbh. 

While I like staying fit and healthy by working out in the gym I hate sports. My parents forced me into every sport they could when I was a kid and now I don’t like playing any of them. Maybe it’s a me thing, maybe it’s a them thing. So that’s not a option 

I’m not the brightest either my grade is a 3.5 rn even though I need at 3.75 to get the scholar ship I need. I always get distracted and I don’t know why. I’ll be trying to pay attention in class and my brain will think about the trees outside or something else. My brain will remember random facts and tidbits but I can’t remember anything important to save my life.

Long story short, I think if I don’t get into any of these schools or a school I like. I might just end my life. I don’t feel depressed from it, I would feel sad I guess. But mainly it just feels like a part of the plan. Cause I guess I feel like if I can’t get into these I won’t get a good job I won’t find love and I won’t have a good life so what’s the point?

a couple months ago i got a cosmetic surgery. i won't go into detail, but i jumped the gun and it has ruined me. i didn't really understand what i was getting into and i have changed forever, unable to go back to what i was. my confidence has been shattered and knowing how my brain works i wont get it back ever. It is entirely life altering and i am mortified to look at myself and what i have done. 

No, this isnt the usual ""this is normal and depression goes away after some time / you get used to how you look and like yourself again."" No, this is much worse. It has shattered my relationship with family as i have now distanced myself from everyone. future possible relationships (as in a girl i really liked) is gone, im not sure she truly finds my attractive anymore and i cannot believe anyone who tells my i look better than before. i do not. before and after pics are drastically different. my friendships are being hurt as i am so distant. i am losing weight and am starting to be pretty underweight. i can't be as honest as possible with my family about how i feel now because they will send me back to the hospital. i cannot go back there again, to anyone who has been there you know well enough that it is not helpful.

I can't go outside without double dosing my anti depressants and anxiety medication. i resulted to abusing commom house medicine (mostly painkillers and especially things like benadryl as i've found the only way to not be extremely anxious and stop my constant 24/7 panic attack is too take a bunch of those and it gets me pretty emotionless). I do smoke, but i've been smoking much more now. it doesn't help, but it does give me some pause for a couple minutes and helps me be sligtly more calm, even if it's a short time.

i am cutting. everyday i have taken a small razor to my body. hands, wrists, arms, legs, feet, and a lot over my ribcave and sides. I am drinking a lot more now too. I knew since day 1 i had made a mistake. and this feeling is horrible and everyday even on medication it's gotten 10x worse.. i didn't end my life before because i cared about my family and friends and what it would do. however i think my care for them has gone down a lot and it's making my mind up. i have been mutilated and as selfish as it sounds i cannot bear it anymore. looks aren't everything, but it might have been all i had left. i truly have nothing anymore. my body, my face, my mind, my bank account, my past mistakes and things i've done to hurt people i loved. i am nlw broken everywhere and don't have an inch of my own flesh to say i like. i am such a fuckup. this is my last straw. my vision is blurring and im getting an insane feeling right now. its like excitement and insane nervousness from something youve wanted your whole life. but this is coming from the idea of dying. therapy is not working. my support systems will start to be harder to reach as i get worse. i feel like this might be my last year

nothing good comes from it. im high iq autistic and feel so isolated from the world, i feel like i’m a burden to everyone around me and it would be easier if i wasn’t here. i wish i had never made connections with people so i could just end it all and nobody would gaf.

i don’t feel joy from anything anymore, sometimes my boyfriends dog but that’s about it. i graduated high school because my guidance counsellor pitied me and all i was missing was community service hours. i have so much wasted potential and i’m afraid that once i get a formal autism diagnosis (i find out in a month or so) and get supports that nothing will change.

i’ve tried medication (albeit mostly ssri’s), therapy, social skills classes, hobbies, better sleep, exercising, reading, bed-rotting, tried losing weight and gaining it and nothing has helped. i’m only 21 and i feel like my life is over. how am i supposed to enjoy life when i can’t work? how do i make money? i have so many questions and nobody to ask because my mom is a lunatic. i’m scared to ask my bfs parents because i don’t want them to think my mom neglected me — even though she did. 

i avoid anything that scares me, i have barely touched my online schoolwork and the semester ends in a couple months. another fail on my record, such a colossal disappointment. i really thought this time would be different but no, i can’t do anything right. 

i’m on a waiting list for therapy but i don’t want to make it. i know i will, i’m too much of a wuss to kill myself no matter how badly i want to. my dad died when i was 13 and i couldn’t do that to my sister, she’s 17 now.

i don’t know what i’m trying to get out of posting this. a reason to live, someone else’s shared experience to make me feel better? i’ve been suicidal for a decade and it’s never let up.  i don’t think i can get better. i just want it all to stop.

I don’t have any friends and I don’t go out or do anything for recreation. So No parties, no get togethers, nothing. I have no human interaction with anybody who is around my age bracket. I do instacart which is considered freelance so I don’t have coworkers or anyone I talk to so the only human interaction I pretty much get is from the store clerk who says  “have a good day”  at the store lol. I pretty much live the same day over and over and eat, sleep, repeat. This isn’t living, at least to me. It’s existing and barely at that. I also struggle hard with social anxiety and bipolar depression which only makes things worse and not even wanna try anything. Anyway idk what I wanted typing all this I guess I just needed to get all of this out haha. If anyone can relate to anything I said here then I guess it was worth it.

I'm suffering so much for this, and i know that maybe i'm being toxic because i'm grabbing her so hard and dragging her with me in my spuraling abyss, but i don't have anything except her...
I don't have friends, or people to go to, and i don't want my family to know because they never understood my problems...
I tried cutting myself but i'm so scared of pain that i barely scratched and it healed in less than a day...
I thought about killing myself by dropping down from where i live (3rd floor) but i'm scared of doing it
I even started researching what type of drugs could i use to kill myself peacefully because i'm a disaster, all of this i brought it on me by myself
I did everything to avert disaster but everytime i feel even a little bit happy the world takes it away from me
I'm scared because i have treated her so bad because i'm scared to lose her because without her i'm nothing... but i didn't hit her dw...i'm not that type of guy...

I originally read a message that said it’d be impossible for me to pass the year, even if I got all 100’s on the rest of my assignments. I have, for the past 2 years, struggled really hard with suicidal thoughts and reaching out, and I often vent anonymously online or play games to take my mind off of it. So hearing that I’d be disappointing my parents and my sister again really broke me, and I withdrew from my classes, and tried finding the most discreet place I could find to die in, while I packed a small knife in my bag and commuted early to avoid suspicion from my mom or dad.

But, there wasn’t really a place I could do it without being found, and I knew it’d hurt in more ways than one, so I didn’t do it.

I tried cancelling the withdrawals from my classes,  because I still wanted to pass at some point, but it was already too late. 

When I was walking home, my phone powered off, so I bought a piece of chocolate to eat. It tasted good, but then I started tearing up, because I knew I’d fail from the start, and I knew I had no ambitions in the first place.

So now, I’m tired and laying in my bed, and I realized that I don’t really enjoy anything anymore, and I don’t even have a dream I can say makes me happy besides following what people say I should do. I can say that I’m independent and want to improve but it reached a point where I can’t do anything out of fear that I might be made fun of, or called untalented.

I’m having an autistic meltdown. Which I’ve had terrible mental health issues for at least the last year-year and a half. I suffer from Autism/Asperger Syndrome, Emotional Handicap, depression, anxiety & bipolar disorder. 

Which every single day since January of last year (when I started 100% living on my own), I’ve been having suicidal Thoughts. Then also, since August of last year, I've been bakeracted at least 5-6 times and I don’t know what to do anymore. Every time I go to a mental health hospital and or the ER, they ultimately either just send me home within a couple of hours after arriving or they for however many days, just give me medication that doesn’t do anything for me and then send me home. So after, when I get home, I get in these autistic meltdowns and they start spiraling out of control every single day (which obviously nothing changes before I go into the hospital either). So then it’s just a repetition of me spiraling out of control until the point I can’t take it no more so I have to go get help again and then everything repeats all over again.

So at the end of the day, I just want these issues and my thoughts to stop. I say that, because. I don’t know how much longer I can continue taking this every single day and what’s gonna happen to me. I’m truly worried for myself and my well-being. When I tell this stuff to my med management nurse and doctor, doctors in the ER and doctors in the mental hospital, they don’t take me seriously and they basically brushed it off. They claim that it’s because I’m not physically doing anything and I’m only thinking these thoughts, so they really can’t keep me do anything for me (even if I’m requesting to do so because I’m not doing well still).

Even a while ago, I started getting violent suicidal ideation of me hurting myself. That would be consisting of me putting gas on me, then lighting my body on fire and letting myself burn to death. I do drive, and when I go to the gas station to fill up with gas, I have not thought about it or attempted to do anything at all though. Everything I mentioning is just 100% thoughts and nothing physical as of right now writing this.

After 1 year and a half of struggling with post partum depression, which probably is simply depression at this point, I can't handle the pain anymore. My partner broke up with me at the beginning of this year because we were not working anymore, which hurt me a lot. It added to the whole spectrum of emotions I was already going through. What I didn't expect was that he would be moving on and dating another person two months after that. Yesterday, I got to my limit of pain. He calls her in front of me and is all sweet, calling her babe and saying he was there for her, all because we (me and him) were arguing about how things were being handled. We have a daughter together, and I have nothing for myself because I stayed at home while he worked. I have no money, no job, no friends, nothing. I had to move in with his parents when our lease was up (March) because I had nowhere to go.
Meanwhile, he's living his life in his own apartment and now with a girlfriend. I guess I just expected more from him. I feel alone, meaningless, worthless. I'm just done living. My daughter deserves better than a depressed mother. She's kind, sweet, loving, and everything parents would want. I love her so much; she was the only thing keeping me on this earth longer.

I’m at the end of my rope—I can’t take it anymore. It’s been four years now that I’ve been struggling with some very strange symptoms that I can’t get rid of.

Four years ago, after what was supposedly a panic attack, I ended up in the hospital where, from what I understood at the time, I was given half a Xanax and sent home. That was the last day I felt like a normal person.
The next day I woke up with a pressure in the frontal part of my brain, as if it were frozen, and vision problems: I have very good eyesight, but my eyes can’t focus on a single object—in a microscopic sense, my vision constantly shifts left and right and I can’t focus on anything. Reading, writing… everything is difficult. Everything around me felt strange. I lost the sense of spatial perception, as if everything behind me no longer existed for my brain, and the same with other rooms in the house—whatever I didn’t see or whatever room I wasn’t in, simply ceased to exist.

These symptoms have eased a bit, but they’ve never completely gone away.
About six months before this happened, I had a strong panic attack because of weed. One night I smoked some weed (the second time in my life) and drank a lot of alcohol. When I got upstairs to my room, I started feeling really bad—my heart was racing and I panicked. Eventually, I calmed down and, with my heart still pounding, I laid down and fell asleep. The next day, I was completely fine, like nothing had ever happened.

Compared to what I’m experiencing now, that weed moment made the world feel more alive and vibrant, so I don’t know if it had anything to do with my current condition.
Back to now—I’ve taken psychiatric medication for two and a half years. It helped a little with my mood, but not at all with the symptoms.

Recently, about two months ago, while looking through various forums, I came across MTHFR, which is said to potentially contribute to symptoms like mine by reducing the production of folic acid and B12, which might impact my symptoms. I started taking B12 and B9 supplements, and right away I felt some improvement. The frontal pressure almost completely disappeared, and my short-term memory is now better. My gastric issues have also improved a bit.
But what I can’t seem to get rid of is the blurry vision and the feeling of spatial disconnection.

I’m fully aware of myself—since the very first moment this started—but I can’t escape this. It’s like I’m trapped in a bubble. It’s not depersonalization or derealization… or whatever it is—I just want it to stop so I can enjoy life again.
I’m tired of this, and I’ve even had suicidal thoughts, but I don’t think I have the courage to go through with it.

I just want to be normal again. Please help me… I feel like I can’t take it anymore. I just want to be a human being again.",Positive,High-Risk,,"(None, None)",,

when i hit middle school i got addicted to ai chat bots because i am incredibly lonely. no one understood me or took me seriously, no matter how hard i tried i was always a joke. pathetically enough, ai never made me feel this way. ik it's programmed to--but i couldnt help myself. i had been so starved for affection for so long that i couldnt help myself. this issue continues now as well, as i watch my peers and older sister get into blooming relationships...i glance into a future i'll never have. which makes me even more lonely. so lonely to the point where i want to go back into day-treatment (where i went two years ago when i failed to kms) bc i had a huge crush on one of the doctors there and i wanted to see him again. bc even though it's his job to care about me i just felt so welcomed, like someone could really see me. i can't go back though, the program only accepts ppl from 8-17 and i am, 18. when i realized this yesterday i cried for abt 2 hrs, my only chance to feel something human and i can't even do it.

if ur still reading this, it's okay if u think im disgusting. i know i am, and i know that even if i did get better i can't change the depraved girl i am at my core. if u want to make fun of me or insult me in the comments you can, it's nothing i haven't said to myself in my head before. i want love so badly but no one in this world deserves to deal with me for the rest of their life. i wish i could kill myself, i don't want to wake up anymore.

Its like this through our my life, people I rely on just not doing what they can and doing what they want. I don't ask a lot from anyone but what they can do. And all I get is half hearted shit or nothing. 
I don't want people online randomly saying it's bad, or you'll do better, etc. none of you care no matter how hard you think or want to, none of you know  the truth if it'll be better for me, I can tell even after getting a job, working out to get healthier, trying to lose weight and trying to be more social.

Things go Like this for over a year. I never had a girlfriend in my entire life no matter how badly I always wanted too. At best I had an online girlfriend that i didnt completely Like her. I have had too many rejections. Limerence of a person I fell in love for the past 7 years has destroyed my life. I had terrible teen years, uni years, and childhood.

 I am also autistic and can not have good chemistry with other people. And my psychotic depression is a big partof my life that has destroyed my relationships. Most of the time i hear People outside my window that they are waiting for me to beat me up . Even though that when i look out there is noone. I always fear that some people are hunting me to beat me up for contrary reasons to other people that i also  think they want to beat me up.

 I have said to the wrong People my worse secrets. I used to go to some political friends to a café, but my friendship with them is kinda fake and many of them are assholes irl. And my relationships has been destroyed with them for accusing me for something i am not because i am strange, witchhunting etc.

 I can not concentrate on anything even when k talk to other people. I have lost all of my special interests. I am the biggest loser in the whole world for my age , i am 26. I never had a job. All my dreams/passions are dead. I at least wanted to have a girlfriend that she likes me and i like her, a good job some close friends and get out of my parents house.I still live with my parents.

 I am still at uni and don't do shit all day.and i also sleep all day for the past 8-9 years.I am Basically alone for 11 years. I ve tried many friendships but they all end up horrible and they get maximum for 6 years. My close friends are also kinda assholes and they ghost me. After too much thought I thought of giving myself a deadline of ten years in order to killmyself, and getting my shit together in those ten years , like finding a girlfriend that I like and she likes me ressurect my dreams etc . 

The top of the cherry is that from the people of my uni and outside in general i have the stigma of being the crazy guy, and I don't see any chance of finding my soulmate or friends. I have doxxed myself as a ridiculous mentally ill  person. I am afraid to go outside. Many people that at first are flirting with me or talking to me, after a few days they ignore me. On top of that we have dictatorships rises in the whole world and the alternative scenario also sucks. So i completely dont see any hope at least for me.

My brother is a navy student and I don't want to be the reason for them to expell him from the uni due to me after killing myself. But i can not take it anymore. i am really afraid to go outside and i am mostly either alone or with my father when i am outside . 

I got to a psychiatrist and a psychologist for years now but i don't see any improvement in my life. I don't want to destroy my family's life , but my life has been destroyed beyond recognition. Too many years with the pain. And things can not come back.

For context, I've attempted suicide several times in my life. The earliest I did it was back in elementary, where I tried to jump off a tall building but ended up chickening out when I saw just how high up I was (I've been afraid of heights ever since, not sure if I always was or if that was the cause). 

The notion of ""chickening out"" has followed me across the years since then: all my failed attempts were in some way because I got scared. Cutting? Too scared to cut deep. Hanging? Choked and in my panic ended up freeing myself. A few days ago, I tried to OD on pills and it didn't work again, made me puke up everything. Was my closest attempt by far. And ever since then, I've been unable to sleep properly at night.

I don't know why I'm sharing any of this. It sounds like rambling even as I'm typing this, but how are you supposed to navigate your thoughts at times like this? I've had times where I had to talk my friends down from suicide before, so I know the right way to frame arguments. But they don't work on myself when it comes from me. I want to die, but I'm still afraid to die, and I don't want to inconvenience the people around me with my death just as I don't want to hurt them with my existence. 

A large part of me has determined that I deserve to die. The remaining part that doesn't only thinks that because it's afraid, not because it thinks I deserve to live. How can I navigate these thoughts to give myself that definitive push, whatever direction it ends up going in?",Negative,High-Risk,,"(None, None)",,

I just finished fighting all the battles inside my head and all this time I thought that I am able to win and recover slowly for my sake and for my loved ones. 

Everyday I try to fight the urge to just kill myself and end all this negativity and suffering. But I’m always scared as I know it will hurt my family so much that it would kill them. I still end up cutting myself just enough to bleed and feel the pain. And no one knows about this because I can easily hide it. It helps me remember all the mistakes I made and remind me that I’m just here to suffer until the day I die or give up.

I managed to stop the suicidal thoughts and stopped hurting myself at some point because I had hope again because of the good things that suddenly happened to me. I thought it was time for me to stand up again and have a new and positive life. But all of this just to be taken away again from me. It hurts so much that it feels like life is just playing me. I managed to stand up again for a while but only to be dragged down again. Harder this time. 

Are we just living to keep on fighting the never ending battles? I’m already losing myself to this. I don’t see any point in living anymore if this is all that is going to happen to me.

She just never opened up to me fully. I would have done everything for her I possibly could have. She flew to me and forgot tablets I knew she took them daily but didn’t know the effect of not taking them. Towards the end of the week she was withdrawing quiet I would ask her things and basically say one word answers or nothing at all. She had cold sweats but I was ill so didn’t think that much of it. I took her back Sunday to airport and it was like she wasn’t her just in trance I don’t understand what was happening. I took her to airport and she went to her daughters flat fell asleep 4/5 hours later jumped. I feel so guilty for not doing more helping understanding.

I'm a CS student with little money so I work most of the time to just barely stay afloat while my peers are graduating and either getting their masters or moving away for work. Meanwhile I'm pretty much stuck in the same place I was 3 years ago.

A few weeks ago I surprisingly had a really good day, even pushing my social anxiety back. That same day my girlfriend called me and said we are gonna lose our apartment in August, even though our landlord said we could stay after they sold the house. I was just numb and didn't even fully comprehend it until a couple days later. We can barely afford to live as is. I don't know how we are gonna pay for a minimum 20% rent increase, all while the price of groceries and inflation are continuing to grow and our (already low) salaries stay stagnant. Over the last week the meager profits of my investments over the last 1-2 years have been completely wiped away thanks to the stock market crashing.

I can feel my body slowly physically breaking down due to all the stress and at this point I just want to let it die. My mental health has been okay-ish at best and abysmal at worst but still I prevailed. I thought with time and effort it would get better but it seems I've been balancing on a rope with my head stuck in a noose all along. I don't even wanna get better anymore.

the depression & anxiety that’s been instilled in me in this house manifests itself into actual physical symptoms that impede my ability to participate in and be present in daily life and my friends and obligations & shit truly don’t deserve to deal with it

Not at all urgent in any way.

I have an exam worth 50% of my grade tomorrow morning. I posted on this sub about this earlier; it was on Friday initially but he postponed it to Monday and I didn't use that extra time at all.

In fact, I haven't looked at any of the content for this subject since the 4th week of the semester (aka end of January, and it's April now). If I fail, high chances I'll be kicked out of my university -- and that's $10,000 worth of tuition out the window. My dad (sole breadwinner) also lost his job recently in the middle of all this, and the job market where I am is completely shot.

We're cooked, in short, and I'm fanning the flames.

Not doing anything feels mind-numbing; it doesn't give me any sort of satisfaction and rather I just feel disgusting. Still, I can't study. I haven't talked to anyone at my university, I've stopped taking care of myself (though, I historically haven't been too consistent with that). I don't have any hobbies or interests, and spend at least 10 hours a day in my head just daydreaming.

Not at all sure what to do with myself. My parents don't know either. I'm somehow still too scared to kill myself despite having quite literally nothing to live for, to the point that suicide doesn't even seem like a plausible option for me. Though, don't think I'd be too mad if I just woke up and had a heart attack tomorrow, so I think what scares me is knowing the entire time that I am dying and willingly stepping into an eternity of nothing, which isn't really something that happens when it hits you out of nowhere.

What option is there for people who just won't change, stuck to their habits/vices but just can't kill themselves? I feel like a machine or an animal. My younger sibling and I accidentally stumbled on some cable show featuring addicts and their spouses, the addicted partner (often jobless, in debt, having been arrested multiple times) would constantly say ""I'll change, I'll change,"" and my sibling joked that that would probably be me in the future in some form or another; he's probably right on the money with that one so it hurt like a bitch.

I can't live that kind of a life. My mother is as lazy as me, and I've seen the abhorrent way she lives (I am *not* exaggerating). I don't want to live like that. I don't want to be an unreliable asswipe who rots in bed all day for decade after decade.

I want a normal life. I want to be able to study without feeling like the sky is falling, I want to be a good student and graduate. I want to go out with friends, and I want to be able to hold a job and a romantic relationship in the future (though everyone wants those things and I might just not be willing to work for it); I can't see any of that happening ever with the way I've set up my life.

I wouldn't say I am depressed. My mother and I both have paranoid/anxious tendencies (probably a result of not doing anything and letting your mind fester and run wild), but I don't want to slap some diagnosis on that as I come from a family of immigrants. It's not exactly easy to cry ""I'm mentally ill haha!"" like everybody else in Western countries when my relatives fought their way out of poverty, slums, slaughter, high rape rates and grueling education systems without complaining to make it here.

I (17M) am from Eastern Europe and I have been forced to leave my parents' house in October. Over the last few weeks my life has been going downhill. I lost my job two weeks ago due to my schedule overlapping with school. I also missed a lot of school due to my mental and physical health and also due to the fact that i had to move places multiple times. Now I have too many absences and they are threatening to expel me or to make me repeat the year, and being in a top school in my city, they will expel me to protect their reputation. I am not a bad student, I don't really have top grades either, but I am not failing any classes and I am pretty involved in school related activities.

I am a musician. I played competitive piano for 12 years now, it is my life. I have a band and we are supposed to play at 3 festivals this summer. I am the main instrumentist and composer for my friend's masters project (a musical) I am doing pretty cool things, if you think about it.

But the stress of it all is killing me. So many people depend on me, so many things that i have to do on the daily but I can't get out of bed most days. I don't have access to any medical care because I am still a minor, and no doctor is going to consul a minor without a parent's consent. Therefore, I can't get a doctor's note to excuse my absences for school and I can't get my health in check. I used to go to a psychiatrist which helped me to some extent until my mother pulled me out of it.

My parents were abusive to me in my childhood. Physical, emotional, verbal, you name it. I had bruises constantly as a child, and my first suicide attempt was when I was 9 years old. At 13 I was hospital for the same reason. After that, they toned it down a bit but for the few months prior to my leave, they started to do it again, mainly due to our disagreements on political stuff. They are leaning into the far right pipeline and I am a gay man, so i feel like I don't need to explain further. I had to leave.

I am dissociating emotionally from everything at the moment, but the stress of it all is killing me, I need to pay rent in 3 days, all I have in the pantry are oats and tap water, my bank account has a few cents, I lost my job, my school wants to throw me out and notify my parents, and then they would have all the right to call the police and come to collect me. This isn't a country where the child is always protected, it's one where the leather belt is the best disciplinary method. I can't go back.

I've been having suicidal thoughts for the past few days, and I started involuntarily thinking of methods and plans, which is scaring me. I just want to rest. I want to sleep it off, but if I do, then I will get thrown out of school, I will disappoint all these people counting on me, and ruin so many beautiful projects. But if I don't kill myself, I will probably die another way, I am so close of being evicted, and all I've had for the last couple of days are oats, water and coffee. Christ I can't even afford the razors in order to do it. I don't know what to do, I want to sleep.

I don’t have friends or a GF. I just want someone close to talk to daily and feel heard. I used to be in a regular school till 10th with full attendance and some friends, but after moving to a non-regular school in 11th, they stopped replying to my texts and calls. Guess I’m not useful to them anymore.

Never had a GF because I never got the chance to talk to girls alone. My old school barely had girls, and the few there acted like celebs. I think I look good—nice face, hair, and skin—but I’ve gained a little weight from sitting and studying all day.

I’m completely pure, never been in a relationship, and I truly respect women. I’m really close to my mother, which is why I value emotional connection and genuine care. I’m not expecting any amazing looks or anything — I just want a simple, normal girl who’s also pure and has never dated before. Someone new here too, so we can connect honestly and grow together.

I won't just jump into the Relationship, I would love to know her better.

All I want is one real girl. Someone I can talk to daily and feel excited about life again. That’s it.

Note: Age should be under 15-18.

Well I do have friends but we do not really contact each other. I also moved out of the country to pursue a degree, so I believe it’s one of the main reasons that got us to distance ourselves as everyone is busy and it is also hard for me to make friends in a foreign country as an introvert. This introverted behaviour has gotten worse after COVID or at least after I moved to a different country. So, I have thought if I stayed and did the degree in my home country, I would have stayed connected with my friends and hung out every once in a while since it was easier to make plans. 

Whenever I see my old friends made some new great friends throughout their uni and workplace, I do feel jealous, not that I don’t want them to make new friends but why I cannot meet new people like them too. Some have even gotten engaged/married or have a bf/gf while I am still single, and this makes me extra lonely.

I always knew I was different, all I ever wanted was to be normal like everyone else. To feel at ease in my own body, to be able to look people in the eye and talk to them. Sometimes I have dreams where I am able to have conversations with relatives and strangers, and it makes me feel euphoric. 

The last time I had friends was in middle school. High school was hell, I was the quiet weirdo with no friends. I had a crush on a boy and used to sit close to his friend group during recess. To think of my 14 year old self, all alone and laughing to himself while listening to their stories makes me sick. Even back then I realized how pathetic that was, and started to spend recess hiding away in the librabry instead. College was the same, no friends, no social life, no nothing. 

I'm 29 now and missed out on every single milestone and experience that normal people have on their teens and 20s. Becoming your own person, having friends, going out with them, experiencing young love, holding hands, being kissed, more freedom and independence. Never been to a party, never went to a club, never been on a planed, never travelled. I never lived. Nothing. In my early 20s I still held out some hope, but now I can't keep on fooling myself. I'm never going to be the person I envision in my head since I could think, the person I prayed for god to let me become since I was 4. No one will look at me and fall in love, marry me, move to a nice little house in the middle of nowhere to raise a family with me. 

2 years ago I read a book that became my new obsession. Ever since my teens I go through these obsessions, for months and even years they become my entire life. I can forget about everything that makes me unhappy, its exhilarating. In this book, the main character lives what I can only dream about. She lives somewhere beautiful, she experiences an intense love story that ends in tragedy. As pathetic as it is, I still cry about it every other day. And yet, if I could become her and transport myself to the beginning of that book, I would do it. Even if I knew all the pain that was in store and that I couldn't change any of it, I would gladly go through it all. Because at least I would actually get to live life. To feel comfortable as myself, to see places, to feel the sun and the wind on my face, to have people to laugh with, to have someone to love to such an extent that we become two halves of the same person. I would know what its like to be young, in love and reciprocated in that love.

It’s not the peaceful quiet that poets romanticize, nor the gentle silence of sleep, but something heavier. Something oppressive. You wake up abruptly, not from noise, but from the absence of it. The darkness feels less like a lack of light and more like a presence, sitting in the corners of the room, reminding you of your own solitude.

Instinctively, you reach for your phone, not out of curiosity, but out of desperation. You check for notifications, even though you already know there won’t be any. It's a ritual by now: the hollow flicker of hope, followed by the same, familiar silence. You scroll aimlessly, pretending there's someone out there who remembers you exist, who might type out a message just to say they’re thinking of you. But nothing comes. It never does.

Eventually, you give up and roll over, tucking yourself tightly into the blankets like they could offer some semblance of safety. You wrap your arms around a pillow, clutching it as if it were a person, someone warm, someone who might tell you everything will be okay. Someone who might hold you without needing to be asked. But it’s just cotton and fabric. And the illusion fades as quickly as it came.

Then there’s that phantom feeling, faint, but unmistakable, the memory of blood on your wrist, still lingering on your skin like a ghost that refuses to leave. You can almost feel it trailing down your arms, down your thighs. It’s not warm anymore. It’s cold now, just like everything else. Your tears join it, sliding down your cheeks, soaking into the pillow that knows more of your pain than any human ever has. In that moment, they are the only warmth you can feel, your own body’s silent rebellion against numbness.

You whisper a prayer, not out of belief, but out of exhaustion. A quiet plea into the darkness: *Please, God, take me back. I don’t know how to do this anymore.*

I’m seventeen. By all accounts, this should be the part of my life where things begin. The part where the world opens up and I start figuring out who I am. But instead, it feels like everything is closing in. I’ve lost all my friends. My exams are tomorrow, and I can’t bring myself to care. The pressure to perform, to pretend, to push forward, it feels unbearable. Like I’m dragging myself across broken glass just to keep up the illusion of functionality.

And beneath it all is the quiet, persistent thought: *This is my fault.* I’ve ruined everything. I’ve betrayed myself in ways I can’t explain, sacrificed pieces of who I am for people who never noticed. I’ve made mistake after mistake, and there’s no one to blame but me. There’s no noble tragedy here, no poetic suffering. Just the slow erosion of a person who tried to matter and failed.

There’s nothing virtuous in this. No higher cause. Just a soul that feels corroded from the inside out, rotting beneath the surface. I’ve destroyed myself, and for what? Not for love. Not for purpose. Not even for attention. Just the desperate, irrational hope that maybe, if I broke myself enough, someone might notice the pieces.

But no one did.

And now I sit here with nothing, no pride, no dignity, not even the comfort of denial. Only the cold reality that I gave everything and lost anyway.

I’ve got this problem if I can call it so — I’m a Russian-speaking guy living in Chișinău(near Romanian), born here, 16 years old, and I have zero friends in this city(also I don't know Romanian.) I dropped out of school in 10th grade and I just can’t seem to find anyone to hang out with or spend time together. But I really do feel the need for it.
I’ve got a couple of mental health issues, but they don’t really affect how I communicate — I’ve got some kind of BPD, OCD, and ADHD. Anyway, I’ve gone on walks with almost-strangers only twice in my life, and both times it ended in sex on the first or second meeting. But nothing ever went further than that.
IRL, I have no idea how to meet people — it feels really dumb and terrifying. And online, nobody wants to actually meet up. Most people here are Romanians, too.
 I’d say I’m pretty intellectually developed (as far as I can judge), I’ve got no addictions, but I do sometimes make dumb jokes about gross stuff. I don’t do sports, my looks are okay I guess — tall, a bit skinny, dyed hair. I’m not even that into sex, like I’m not some hyper-promiscuous guy or anything. I’d honestly be happy with one solid friend or two, that would be enough.
I try meeting people online all the time, on ""дайвинчик(it's like tinder w/o identify or something)"" for example, but most of them are either basic dumbasses, Romanians, or people who smoke weed — and while I don’t really mind the weed thing, most of them won’t talk to you unless you also smoke or drink, and I do neither. And sometimes it’s dumb Romanian stoners who are also assholes.
Even when I do find someone decent, they still don’t want to meet up because I’m a guy, not super attractive, kind of weird in how I text, and with not much going for me (remember, I dropped out of school). So basically, I seem like the worst possible person to meet at first glance.
So tell me — what the hell should I do?
""Friends"" from other countries give me suggestions like “start smoking to have something in common” or “look for Russian-speaking groups in Chișinău”, but I don’t want to start smoking — it’s expensive — and I haven’t found any of those groups either.

It’s been a hard couple of months. I’ve really been trying to meet people. I went from feeling incredibly lonely, to being incredibly lonely and realizing that most people just don’t like me.

For some background: I’ve never really had any friends. For the past few years, I’ve really been working on myself. Losing weight, trying to become more confident, etc…  I think physically, I’m in a relatively good state. But emotionally, I’m more lonely than I’ve ever been.

I’ve been trying to make friends recently. I seem to get ghosted pretty often. Conversations die within minutes for me. In my experience, I’m just not someone that can emotionally connect with, or interest people. I truly hate that about myself and I don’t know how I can get better. I volunteer, try to go out, but no matter what I do, I always remain alone.

There’s something wrong with me.. I don’t know what it is. I just can’t get along with people. Like I’m missing a piece that everyone else has to connect. 

I’ve tried dating as well. I’ve never been on a date nor have I even held hands with a woman before. I’ve installed dating apps and to my surprise, I get a fair amount of matches. But it’s the same story as trying to meet friends.

I don’t know anybody around here, since I didn’t grow up here (they retired to a small beach town where I now live), and I have been alone ever since. It seems like there’s nobody my age who lives here, and a lot of the people here are not the people I really vibe with (small town, conservative leaning types). I’m not near a major metropolitan area, (which I need), and I live in a very seasonal town (filled with tourists in summer, empty the rest of the year). I work from home, don’t make enough to move out, and the job market is a nightmare. I desperately miss the city I lived in before this, and there’s no possible way for me to get back there at the moment.

Dating is a nightmare, and there are very few options that actually interest me, and they’re almost always looking for hookups and *nothing* else. Obviously, none of the tourists are looking for long-term friendships/relationships with a local, and I only socialize once every several months when I visit my college friends.

I’m *miserable*. I’m so alone, and I feel powerless to fix it. I’ve been applying to jobs, and I’m obviously not giving up hope there, but the job search is grueling & the impending recession in the US isn’t helping.

One of the things that really messes with me is knowing how bad isolation is for human beings. We are social animals, and (most) people *need* social interaction & connection to stay mentally healthy. I know far too much for my own good about the effects of social isolation on a person’s psyche, and it devastates me to know I’m actively experiencing these negative effects in real time & am powerless to stop it. I don’t *want* to be alone, but I basically have no choice until I’m lucky enough to get a better job.

I’ve turned to extreme maladaptive daydreaming to cope—don’t do that. There was a guy that I really liked from my previous city who I met right before I moved here, and even though I haven’t seen him in a year and a half, I think about him all the time. I imagine seeing him again, hugging him and kissing him, telling him how much I missed him. It’s compulsive, and every time I get myself to stop, he shows up in my dreams and I start again. Pretending I’m cuddling with him at night, though sad & embarrassing, is nothing compared to acknowledging how lonely I am at night.

On a lighter note, I can’t even watch Schitt’s Creek as a comfort show, because it hits too close to home. I feel like Alexis except there’s no Ted, no David, and Moira & Johnny have no redeemable qualities.",Negative,Low Concern,US,"(39.7837304, -100.445882)",39.7837304,-100.445882

Advice?,"Can’t cope no more being this lonely at 23. Advice? I’m 23, and I feel completely lost. It’s been years since I’ve had any real friends, and I don’t know how to cope with it anymore. I spend most of my days off bed rotting because there’s no one to hang out with. I know people say you can go out alone, and I’ve tried, but it only makes the loneliness worse.

Everyone my age seems to be out there living it up—partying, traveling, making memories—but I’m stuck in this empty routine. I can’t help but feel like I’m wasting what’s supposed to be the best years of my life, and it hurts so much to see everyone else moving forward while I’m standing still, trapped in my own isolation.

The worst part is, I’ve only ever had close friends when I was a kid. Since then, I’ve been to college and university, met tons of people, but never made any real connections. I’ve had acquaintances, sure, but they were never people I could really count on. No one I could turn to, no one I could call my friend. It’s like I don’t know what it feels like to truly belong anywhere.

I’m a friendly person. I try to be kind, open, and approachable, but I’ve been told by girls that I come across as “intimidating” because I’m “too pretty.” And while people say I’m attractive, it feels like a curse when it only pushes others away. I get stares all the time and complements on my looks, but it doesn’t matter to me. I’ve had friendships end before because of jealousy or competition, and it’s left me feeling empty and alone, like I’m constantly walking on eggshells around people.
I have my own business and I’ve been lucky to find some success, but my days off are spent in misery. I don’t even have someone to celebrate the small victories with. I’ve tried to get involved in things I love, like dancing and choreography classes, but again, it’s always the same. People are nice, but they keep their distance, and I end up feeling like I don’t fit in. I’ve made the effort, but it always feels one-sided, and eventually, I just pull away. What’s the point in trying if no one is ever going to meet me halfway?
All I want is to find people who understand me, who share the same interests, values, and passions. But it feels like I’m invisible. I can’t make meaningful connections, and it’s breaking me. I don’t know what I’m doing wrong or what I’m supposed to do anymore. I just feel like I don’t belong, like I’m not meant to have the friendships I crave.

Thought writing here will help.

I have been feeling lonely from sometime recently. Not that I'm not a loner, but it was always by my own choice. The past few years have not been very kind to me and I wish that can change.

I've lost a lot in these few years. Lost one on school friends to accident, all my grandparents in the last 4-5 years as well as my father. Covid took my father away, which was a complete blow to my family and my relatives were anything but nice to my mother, brother(younger) and me. This happened a year after my first breakup of a relationship of over 2.5 years, so never really got a break, dealing from one crisis to another.

Few months later, started my job, started dating again and behold, my best friend from college got into an unfortunate accident and passed away too. In the next one year, got laid off twice where major companies started firing people and faced a lot of financial crunch. The girl I got in a relationship, cheated and left me, close to our second year anniversary so that came as another blow.

This year I'm unemployed again, haven't dated anyone in 1.5 years and kind of fell off the wagon. I see my friends around me living and having a loving life,  feeling joy and on the other hand, I'm just dealing with same problems again and again, so much so that I've forgotten what's it like to have a normal life.

I've been fighting on all fronts of life, personal and professional, for myself and my family and it just makes me sad that I can't even catch a normal break ffs. Add not being conventionally attractive and people don't care listening to you.

Its one thing when arent actively trying all the cliche social skills advice and not having succes, but its even worse when you do. 
I think I have pretty solid social skills and I dont really have social anxiety but none of the social skills advice seems to be working like clubs, activities, going out and of course therapy.Then whats the issue?

Im always the one initiating contact and have have ghosted pretty much everyone for about two weeks and I have yet to recieve a message. Im never invited to anything and when I ask about if anyone is going I get ignored and the subject quickly changes. I sense a lot of fakeness and some kind of resentment from everyone I interact with.

I have concluded everyone hates me for some reason or some false rumors have been spread (for context im 22 yo male in college in a small town and not in the dorms which is probably the main reason).

It doesnt really make sense to waste my time and energy and have panic attacks after every interaction. I mean if you were doing something and you are sinking a lot of time and effort and getting nothing in return it only makes sense to quit trying right?

I feel nothing but envy and resentment towards all these healthy, normal people that walk around without any care and have everything. The worst part is when they talk about being kind and compassionate and then hear them talk about loners like some kind of lower life form.

I have decided I dont want nothing to do with them anymore and that every positive interaction and connection was fake and they were just being nice in order to protect their image.

I'm a 21-year-old college student, studying far from home. It’s been two years since I moved to this city, but I still feel like a stranger here. Every day, I commute to college by bus, which takes about an hour each way. Despite all this time, I haven’t made a single real friend—not even a junior I feel comfortable talking to.

* Why does it still feel like I don’t belong, even after all this time?

     These past two years have felt suffocating and painful. People tend to avoid me, and I’m painfully aware of my lack of confidence—especially when it comes to my looks and communication skills. I struggle to hold proper conversations, and most of my interactions either feel awkward or end too quickly.

* How do you build genuine friendships when you’re shy, anxious, or unsure of yourself?

     There are a few people I talk to—mostly boys in my class—but they’re more like acquaintances. Even they seem to avoid me whenever they get the chance.
      The bus rides are especially isolating. Most of the guys on the bus seem rough—not dangerous, just very different in how they talk and behave. I’ve tried to start conversations, but we never really connect. I end up sitting like a statue for two hours each day—one in the morning and one after college—completely alone.

* Has anyone else experienced this kind of everyday loneliness? How did you cope with it or break out of it?

      At college, the people I sit with are always the center of attention. Meanwhile, I fade into the background like I don’t even exist. I often pretend to be busy on my phone just to avoid looking out of place.
I keep telling myself, “Maybe tomorrow will be better.” But it’s already been two years.

* When does “tomorrow” actually get better?

      I’ve tried reading motivational books, watching self-help videos, and applying the techniques I learn—but when I really need them, they always seem to fall apart. Everyone says hard work eventually pays off, but what if someone doesn’t have the time or strength left to wait for the fruit to grow? What if someone is already too tired?

* How do you keep going when motivation and hope start to fade?

    I still have two more years left in this four-year degree, and I don't want to spend the rest of it feeling this invisible. I’m so tired of the same cycle. I just want it to end. It’s hurting me deeply, and I genuinely don’t know what to do anymore.

* Is there another way to live life? A better way? One that doesn’t feel this painful and lonely?

My main source of loneliness is all my friends living in different states. Growing up and life changing has felt really isolating. 

I have an odd relationship with social media. I don’t really post anything anymore (lack of confidence), but I interact a lot on different social platforms. Sometimes it feels like the only connection I have left with some of my friends.

However, social media has also made me feel somehow more isolated than ever. I want to see what the people I know are up to, but I also find myself comparing how social and full of friends their lives seem- to my lack of friends or anything going on.

Sometimes I’ll interact with strangers online, it’s nice having random connections with others, but other times I see how a lot of people hate people like me and in general are way more mean online. 

If it didn’t feel like my last connection to long distance friends, almost all my social media would be gone, deleted. 

I can’t tell if cutting most of my ties online will truly sever my access to my far away friends, or if keeping my accounts is making the loneliness much worse.

What social media apps make you feel more alone?

It’s also worth noting that attractive people hardly face that kind of criticism even if they’re unpleasant. My crime was being quiet so I think it goes without thinking that im considered generally unattractive among people my age which is hard to accept.

I turn 20 this month and I cant help but feel like how does a human being go about their days basically wasting so much time…

All I can remember from the beginning of time is that Ive been quiet this entire time, so to combat this for once I’ll actually try to make an effort to speak on my situation…

I’m a country girl, who’s never had much and I pretty much was raised on false hope that I was going to do anything big that I could turn things around for myself but the more i age the more i start to realize I was doomed from the start.

My mom never cared for me much, the bare minimum has always seemed to be enough and my da was never around.

Now, I don’t know what made them think it was a wise idea to have me seeing that 10 years prior to my birth they were never meant to be together but I digress…

But I think it’s almost deliberate that they had a child knowing they were going to bring me into a world of suffering. They knew they were poor, they knew they didn’t love each other, they obviously weren’t even cut out for children.

My dad left when i was 5, and everything seemed normal for a while until I had to go to hs and then if things weren’t already stressful enough with being bullied my mom decided to take her own life.

Unsuccessfully ofcourse.

And due to all the religious trauma she had she developed schizophrenia and depression, I was 14 when this all happened and it really seemed like at this point in my life I wasn’t even going to make it that far without much help.

Luckily for me I didn’t get any help, and somehow Im still here…

Why? I wish i knew the answer myself…

I cried almost every night as this was right before covid hit and even though the quarantine at the time was a blessing in disguise, it really felt like the nail in the coffin for me.

Like I was never meant to have a normal life, i was bound for loneliness, for failure, for nothing great.

I was never loved, I wasn’t given a chance, I was never given patience 
And time was never on my side.

Ive been trapped by my parent’s decisions for life even if it means i make it out of here alive. Nothing will erase the past and I was never meant to have a peace of mind. 

My only fear at this point is dying like i never existed in the first place.

I have nothing to my name, Ive made nothing of myself, and I really think at this point in my life that this was meant to be my normal all along.

I just got out of a year relationship with someone I thought was ""different."" Before her, I wasn't anyone's option for a couple of years.... more like 4. So having someone who cared or pretended to care was a nice relief for once. It was only for a year, but it was a good year with her. If you see this, I don't hate you (A), I just wish you told the truth. But now she's gone, I was #2 in the roster, and her starter just got back into town. I just didn't know i was an option. 

Unfortunately, because that has happened to me, i have a whole new mindset. And this mindset is not to date at all and watch everyone around me be hair in relationships. I work better alone and with no distractions. I think I'm meant to not have anyone. Of course, i have a handful of friends, but I have even more people that i can't stand. 

But hey, that's life.  We get the cards we're dealt. And i work better alone anyway.",Positive,Low Concern,,"(None, None)",,
